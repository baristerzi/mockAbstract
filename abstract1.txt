 The materialization of architectural forms uses new processes aided by digital manufacturing techniques (FD). Five FD techniques stand out: sectioning (serial planes), tessellation, folding, contouring, and forming. This article's objective is to characterize the state of the art of these techniques, from 2009 to 2020 in national and international research bases. The Systematic Literature Review is used from three stages and nine protocol phases. The results indicate the techniques, methods, computer simulations, and applicability in more recurrent materials.

 Material-based design has become a wide approach, gathering under the same umbrella different design practices, which deserve to be accurately reexamined. Material-based design involves material performance in complex integration with informational data and processes. However, material-based design operates a new material condition with historical, social, ethical, and political effects. A new term can be used for materiality not only as an objective substance but also as a knowledge-based interrelated element that requires a balance among actors, tools, matters, and meaning.

 Based on the premise that the form generation phase in the design of handicraft products is one of the most complexes, the article proposes the use of the "Roles of products and users expectations" model by Jacob-Dazarola (2015), and “Pre-inventive 2D and 3D forms” method based on Finke (1993). The methods are evidenced in a case study, in which five handicraft product projects were developed, based on the cultural identity of Guapi, a town in the Colombian Pacific.

 Digitality evidences the existence of writings that contradict the conception of static object. Many avatars of what is written become ephemeral and kinetic: more than objects, they are events. Kinetic writing appears in contemporary works from different disciplinary fields with analog or digital support. Time, expressed in duration, movement and transformation, returns to be the production substance of the sense of the written form — typographic or calligraphic — which is no longer spatial but temporal. The objective is to show how signs mutate to produce meaning from which the transformation, given by the kinetic dimension itself, occurs.

 This paper synthesizes several years of research in the field of the theory of architecture and design, and undergraduate and graduate teaching. Specifically, it is a work that reflects on how architecture and design should face the most important phenomena of our present and near future. These phenomena refer to environmental, technological and anthropological aspects, and the strategies to cope with them, involving alter-native design thinking, fiction and practice in which futurabilities and futurizations depart from the displacement generated by post-utopian visions based on dissidence and subalternity. This is what we call Xenofutures, a design for curing-caring a damaged world.

 Imagining future(s) is a culturally relevant practice throughout all the ages and different social domains. Cultures develop their own imagine of future through several practices that unfold the present. The available design technologies have a primary role in this construction process, driving and altering the vision of what is imagined. Visionary images of the future, whether induced by drawing or other techniques, are real agents of social change. This paper provides a theoretical approach to futures oriented design practices through the analisis of the outcomes of the Imagining Future(s) workshop at Foster Foundation (Madrid) and outlines three methodology tracks detected during the exercize.

 Healthcare design practice has shown increasing interest in the assessment of design alternatives from a human-centered approach, focusing on organizational performance, patient health, and wellness outcomes, in addition to building performance. The goal of this research is to advance building analytics by identifying, defining and implementing computational human-centered design metrics. The knowledge is extracted from an exhaustive literature review in the field of evidence-based design (EBD), which has studied the associations between building features and the occupants’ outcomes but has not yet consolidated the findings into metrics and implications for design practice in a systematic manner. In consultation with industry experts, we have prioritized the evaluation aspects and developed a weighted evaluation framework for assessment of various design options. The developed metrics that input building parameters and output potential health and performance outcomes are implemented in a a parametric environment utilizing add-ons accordingly, and using an ambulatory clinic designed by Perkins&Will as a case study.

 In this paper, we discuss a new tool pipeline that aims to re-integrate lateral thinking strategies in computational tools of architecture. We present a 4-step AI-driven pipeline, based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), that draws from the ability to access the latent space of a machine and use this space as a digital design environment. We demonstrate examples of navigating in this space using vector arithmetic and interpolations as a method to generate a series of images that are then translated to 3D voxel structures. Through a gallery of forms, we show how this series of techniques could result in unexpected spaces and outputs beyond what could be produced by human capability alone.

 The 20th century demonstrated the transformation of cities and architecture, considering diseases and pandemics. With COVID-19, in less than 150 days and around the world, digital explorations emerged and illustrate the architecture transformation, and Latin America was not the exception. These explorations could become design premises for future environments, entertainment design, public spaces, health, and lifestyles after this pandemic. These explorations, supported by digital technology, will also change our ability to respond in an emergency from design, because we will learn to think of new ways to incorporate them into our processes, synchronized with its own evolution.

 We can identify a milestone in computational design theories in the intersection between paradigms derived from theories of complexity and technological developments in the early 90’s. These theories provided the l foundation to build interpretation of the potential of the technology by adopting a language based on complexity to frame processes of generation, analysis, selection and manufacturing. To better understand the roots and direction of computational design theories, this study makes an in-depth literature review of four vectors involved in the formation of current dominant theoretical and technical approaches: theories of complexity, technological developments, professional practice and academia. The information collected is organized in chronological order in parallel timelines to facilitate readings exposing the intersections and synergies. The results show the emergence of theoretical approaches based on the convergence of theories and technologies, proof of concept in professional practice and consolidation in academia.

 One of the most significant public space studies, "A Pattern Language", published in 1977, is until today's background for some contemporary investigations. The aim of this paper is to propose an operationalization of the patterns' network of the book into a network analysis tool. The methodology is based on a new classification of patterns, in addition to what is initially presented in the book: "context patterns" (evidencing pre-existing conditions and potentialities) and "design patterns" (considering possibilities limited by the stakeholder at that location). The digital operationalization can enhance the analytical and predictive character of the work.

 This paper presents the development of a framework to investigate possible intersections between mass customization and flexibility in the furniture scale, based on the notion of complex modularity. The conceptual framework was implemented with parametric design as a prototypical furniture system, which allows dimensional customization and digital fabrication in reduced scale. The system was evaluated through workshops that simulated pre-configuration and reconfiguration layouts in a study room. Results showed that embedding complex modularity into furniture elements and defining measurement intervals contributed to the flexibility of the mass customized alternatives, providing the emergence of unexpected layout compositions and furniture uses.

For this, a theoretical and practical trajectory was developed, such as understanding the characteristics of fractal geometry and the existing software and methods for its reproduction. As a result, a parametric process was developed that allows to recreate fractal patterns in architectural elements, making it possible to identify the necessary steps for their elaboration, identifying the potentialities of their use and the skills necessary to reproduce similar parametric processes.

 The knowledge of geometric-mathematical rules allows to solve several problems about complex systems design and manufacturing. Geometric genesis of surfaces and their properties represent the main basis to solve both constructive and measurement problems. A developable surface can be manufactured starting from a flat strip, using a flexible and nondeformable material. Geometry studies properties that don't change and, therefore, the shape of the strip to obtain a certain configuration after a series of rigid movements. Our goal is to test different approches (Additive Manufacturing vs Subtractive Manufacturing) to manufacture a lamp using a tangential developable surface.

 There is a growing interest in the design and construction of flexible gridshell structures. Although gridshells have been around since the 1960s, they require material resources, technical and mathematical knowledge that have limited their application. Digital processes of conception, fabrication and construction offer-renewed possibilities to tackle these difficulties and to deepen the dialogue between form, material and structural performance. This article documents an empirical and theoretical research on these structures that seeks to integrate gradually the formal and informal processes of Form Finding, considering structural behaviour from the early design stage. The research contributes by reflecting on a series of empirical constructions developed and aims to contribute to the collective debate to expand further gridshells possibilities.

 Computational design, specifically parametric modeling, has played important role in reaching complex forms, optimizations and automations of design processes. In addition to using parametric technology as a tool to generate form, this article aims to discuss the potential of parametric design as a connection between theory and design activity, both in practice and in the teaching activity. To illustrate that, this paper will present results of a bigger research that used the work of the architect Christopher Alexander as a basis for the development of decision-making instruments that deal with the complexity between form and urban life.

 The environmental parameter as a constraint in the initial phase of the design process becomes essential for the promotion of the building's environment comfort. This research explores the principles of space planning and the genetic algorithm considering an environment parameter to obtain optimized-solutions automatically in the initial phase of the architectural design process. For this, a generative system was developing using space planning and a genetic algorithm from an environmental parameter to obtain better solutions automatically. Several studies happened to understand the functioning of the mechanism. The research discusses the results and failures that may have influenced the generative system.

 This study is based on the development of a modeling technique for vault-like structure generation through topological manipulation. Currently, topology-driven form-finding has been implemented in tensile structures, but no further studies have been conducted for compression-only structures. The focus of this study is to approach the problem of highly determined vault shapes by their input topology. The technique operates at the topological level between vertices and edges to create an input 2D topology map. The particle-spring system uses such a map to simulate the resulting 3D mesh geometry. For testing purposes, we explore three generative approaches. The results show the effectiveness of the technique to manipulate the topological relationships that controls the generation of the funicular structures.

 There is a lack of impactful tools or guidance for assessing water consumption or where there can be considerable savings from water capture. While there are many online calculators, spreadsheets, and models for considering predicted building water use, none of them introduce learning through motivation in the process.

The authors propose the use of simple design elements within an modified building performance methodology that can drive awareness and inform the decision-making process relative to the program.

The proposed scheme for final year design studio demands students to participate in the confrontation of reality to understand first-hand through databases; the complex problems of contemporary society and its relationship with the habitat. In order to understand the diverse emergent phenomena of the city, a collaborative work is implemented for the development of a database, occupation maps and territorial dynamics on a micro scale. From the evidence supported by data, students articulate design strategies and specific territorial actions.

 This study aims to better ascertain the influence that urbanistic parameters exert on the production of solar photovoltaic energy regarding different contexts in the city. Modifications implemented between the years of 2012 and 2016, especially on variables such as Maximum Lot Coverage, Floor Area Ratio, and Setbacks, have been evaluated through virtual models that cover areas in three different city districts. Amongst other implications, an increase in the area occupied by the buildings, as well as a decrease in the distance between them, occurred, causing more mutual shading and the loss of the photovoltaic potential associated with the building envelope.

 The quality of an urban space significantly influences the habitability of a city. In an era where buildings are becoming more and more "intelligent", outdoor space needs to evolve to make it more welcoming and to allow it to be shared and appropriate, capable of expanding opportunities and functionality for the inhabitant who lives in it. In this context the COGITO project, is exploring ways to extend the cognitive logic typical of intelligent buildings to the urban space. We propose to appropriate the model developed in COGITO and apply it in a case study of the city of Medellin.

 This paper is a critical essay on the role of intelligent systems in the 21st century and their usage in city optimization that planners and urban designers objectified control. Promulgated in the 2000s in urban design as a form of control, cybernetics became a useful tool and, today, with metropolitan epidemics, transportation, and information fluxes, this field became more visible in the expansion of parametric actions to control and surveil. This evidence had a clear paradox between the determinism of a transparent city and behaviorism of a black-box design, which is commonly sold – and controlled – as a smart city.

 Official data on informal settlements are outdated, scarce, and sometimes nonexistent. Also, existing digital tools to produce spatial data on urban form are not prepared to deal with their degree of heterogeneity. We then propose a method to obtain, structure and analyze georeferenced data, aiming to support participatory planning of precarious settlements in Brazil. The results include mapping basic elements of urban form and also automatic extraction of urban parameters. The method proved relevant to allow not only the collaboration between team members but also the dialogue with community members, revealing its role in fostering a transformative design process.

 In Colombia the last five years the average annual demand for air conditioning increased by 73%. One strategy to increase thermal comfort and reduce the use of cooling systems and energy consumption in buildings is the use of kinetic envelopes as an active response system to changes in the environment. However, there is little literature analyzing their performance and effects on buildings. This research analyses the operation of different envelope systems through digital modelling and simulation of environmental conditions. The aim is to generate a set of defined advantages in the use of kinetic envelopes for the context in the Caribbean region in Colombia.

 This project-based research is an investigation on controlling robotic videography/camera through an interactive physical interface. Here referred to as Robotic Marionette Camera (RMC), this research project is enabling designers and videographers to design precise robotic videography scenarios and camera-paths in the physical world with similar qualities to the digital design environments. Using the ideas of a “digital” camera in design software platforms, RMC looks at concepts such as aiming, zooming in and out, panning, orbiting, and other motions/operations borrowed from cinematography, such as tilting, rolling and trucking amongst others. As a physical/hardware interface, RMC enables real-time interaction with an industrial robot arm through a custom-made hardware controller. Using a tangible interface, RMC users can design, edit, and program therobotic videography paths interactively without a need for programming knowledge.

 The design, development and writing software for computers has transformed from a niche technology into a means of production. Although computation, information technologies, and digitality have become part of the architectural design process, they are not considered as part of a code itself. By looking into history it can be shown that in architecture codes are already present in different forms. The codes found are used to mark the related periods and to point towards a future form of architectural code with computation involved.

 There is an absence of lightweight, sustainable construction materials in contemporary Haitian construction, a fact highlighted in the disproportionate loss of life in the 2010 Port-au-Prince earthquake. Between 2014 and 2017 the authors delivered a series of architectural design workshops in Haiti to raise awareness and develop design skills for bamboo using computational design tools. This paper provides a review of these workshops and a preliminary evaluation from surveys conducted with the course participants. Results showed architectural education had changed perceptions of bamboo and showed potential positive ecological impact due to subsequent reforestation activities instigated by participants. Weaknesses were in the lack of subsequent use of parametric modelling software. Bamboo material knowledge and a new architectural design methodology have been most relevant to their professional or academic work.

 This practice-led research lies at the intersection of design, craft, materials science, and biology. Inspired by the responsive mechanism of plant’s biological actuators, and Nature's outstanding capacity of attaining maximal performances while using minimum resources. This thesis explores how to achieve a higher level of integration between the generation of form and behavior with its materialization and fabrication.

The results showed a concern about the lack of academic spaces to train with skills and conscience about the topic. Likewise, these allowed the construction of this guide, where knowledge that promotes more sustainable consumption and production could be imparted.

 This paper presents experimental and simulated façade thermal and humidity performance assessments concerning three (3) types of widely used façade systems in the Dominican construction market: 8” block wall, ventilated façade & curtain wall. Using indoor and outdoor temperature (ΔT) and humidity differences (ΔH) as indicators in order to compare said performances between the systems and, in turn, with environmental simulations approximating them, we try to diagnose weaknesses and foresee improvement avenues for sustainable façade systems in the Dominican context. The data was obtained by on-site measurements using eight (8) temperature and relative humidity sensors in a twelve (12) storey building in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

 This article presents a Biomaterial Design Methodology based on the idea that common people can produce objects using bio-based ingredients to create biomaterials and digital fabrication technologies as tools to drive the design processes. The emergence of biomaterials opensource recipes in maker communities and digital fabrication laboratories open new approaches for design, raising the idea that designers can become cookers, controlling all design process and its potential outcomes. The methodology presents four steps to develop recipes and biomaterials to achieve a final product design without requiring any previous knowledge. Also combines different digital fabrication techniques to produce new material expressions, systems, functionalities and products.

 The present project aims to influence the reduction of the urban heat island effect (UHI) by designing sensitive surfaces that respond to changes in temperature. This research presents a scenario with a vision of cities with adaptive designs that is generated from the insertion of elements sensitive to the environment (elements that respond to environmental stimuli). Responsive elements become constant factors in small-scale or large-scale design that transform the way environment is changed to a sensitive and resilient urban environment against possible adverse environmental conditions.

 Discrete responsive systems lack functional autonomous transformation, in response to environmental conditions and users' demands; due to shortage in direct integration of biological intelligence. Bioactive hybrids are sufficient solutions as they perform independente self-replication, differentiation of cellular structure, active metabolism, spatial propagation, adaptation, transformation, and morphogenesis. In this paper, a methodology is proposed for the design, fabrication and implementation of these hybrids in the built environment; highlighting their sustainability potentials, by merging synthetic biology, bioengineering and bioprinting, to achieve multiscale active responsiveness. The current work is part of research in biosynthesizing fibroblasts as transformative material in architectural sustainability.

 In this research, we propose an alternate consumption cycle in which the traditional landfill waste disposal model is averted by developing design objects that are fabricated with household biowaste materials. Food decomposition in landfills not only wastes the energy and emissions input into the original production process, but also releases methane. By rerouting this waste for secondary use as novel design objects and tools, in this research we seek to prevent some amounts of household biowaste from reaching landfills. This process, that we call waste-tooling, repurposes food waste to make kitchen tools by employing different fabrication strategies.

 Greenhouse issues in existing glass-enclosed buildings can be controlled by optimizing energy efficiency and thermal comfort using low cost, customizable, customizable, open source, transferable resources. For such objectives, it is necessary to strategically link algorithmic, heuristic and manufacturing processes. For the case study, the creation of a personalized data acquisition device (DAQ) and a post-occupational evaluation APP (POE) enabled us to advance on real-time building energy efficiency operating on the need for comfort in the rooms and users.

 This study departs from the data exploration of the people dynamics within a university campus to foster solutions of sustainable mobility and environmental regeneration. The research has dealt with a critical challenge of guaranteeing the privacy of individuals' registration data, following the recommendations listed in the foreseen General Data Protection Law. While ensuring anonymity, the work aims to assess the contribution of databases as infrastructures that can convey relevant knowledge beyond scientific research and to guide public management to the trends advocated for the future of universities.

 Due to the reality of the constructive densification process at urban areas in disproportion to urban vegetation cover, the aim of this paper is to formulate two indicators for measuring vegetated density. A proportion between vegetated density and built density was proposed. In order to develop a system of computational tools, an algorithmic-parametric framework called Indicators for Urban Green (IUG) was implemented. The focus is on the internal validation of the IUG through testing hypothetical urban situations. The proposed method leans on the premise of contributing to quanti-qualitative studies focused on mitigating the impacts of anthropogenic action caused at the microclimatic scale of cities.

 This research proposes a Spatiotemporal Modeling approach to understand the role of architecture, specifically the built environment, in the COVID-19 pandemic. The model integrates spatial and temporal parameters to calculate the probability of spread of and exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus (responsible of COVID-19 disease) due to the combination of four aspects: Spatial configuration, organizational schedules, people’s behavior, and virus characteristics. Spatiotemporal Modeling builds upon the current models of building analytics for architecture combined with predictive models of COVID-19 spread. While most of the current research on COVID-19 spread focuses on mathematical models at regional scales and the CDC guidelines emphasizing on human behavior, our research focuses on the role of buildings in this pandemic, as the intermediate mechanism where human and social activities occur. The goal is to understand the most significant parameters that influence the virus spread within built environments, including human-to-human, fomite (surface-to-human), and airborne ways of transmission, with the purpose of providing a comprehensive parametric model that may help identify the most influential design and organizational decisions for controlling the pandemic. The proof-of-concept study is a healthcare facility.

The paper describes a research experiment of incorporating quantitative aesthetic evaluation and feeding the metric back into a parametric model to steer the search within the design space for a high-ranking design solution. The experiment is part of a longer-standing interest and research in quantitative aesthetics. A web platform inspired by dating apps was developed to retrieve an aesthetic score of images (drawings and photographs of architectural projects). The app and scoring system was tested for functionality against an existing dataset of aesthetic measure (triangles, polygon nets). In the actual experiment, an evolutionary algorithm generated images of design candidates (phenotypes) and used the aesthetic score retrieved by the ``crowd'' of app users as a fitness function for the next generation/population. The research is in the tradition of empirical aesthetics of G. T. Fechner (Fechner, 1876), using a web app to crowdsource aesthetic scores and using these to evolve design candidates. The paper describes how the system is set up and presents its results in four distinct exercises.

The fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the computational fusion of physical, digital and biological systems. Increasing information in terms of size, speed and scope exponentially. This fusion requires improved, if not new, tools and methods to deal with complexity and information processing. By opening Generative Systems to interact with the context, we believe that they can develop solutions that are more adequate for our time. This research began with a literature review about generative systems and their application to solve problems. We then selected the tools, Cellular Automata, L-Systems, Genetic Algorithms and Shape Grammar, and thought about how to translate these original mathematical tools to specific design situations. We tested the application of these tools and methods in a workshop, implementing recursive loops to open these techniques to interference. Analysing the empirical results made us revise our design thinking, relying on the study of complexity to understand how these techniques can be more context-aware, so we can make design evolve. Finally, we present a comparative framework analyses that interlaces techniques and methods, so in the future we can merge physical, digital and biological information.

The transport infrastructures are important elements in the cities, but, as there is a lack of planning, they tear through the urban fabric and leave empty spaces. Due to government and private disinterest, these spaces become vacant, forgotten and degraded. However, these extensive Terrain Vague offer new potential for urban use. To exploit this potential, we need methodologies that can offer personalised, extensive, feasible urban solutions. For this, we propose a computational generative system, following a 4-step methodology: 1) Site analyses and Terrain Vague identification; 2) Site classification according to parameters based on a ``visual grammar''; 3) Algorithm associating space properties with geometric transformation to generate solutions: namely transformative operations in public spaces, additive transformations in semi-public spaces and subtractive operations in semi-private spaces; 4) Solution evaluation and development, according to shade criteria, spatial hierarchy and volumetric density. With our own algorithms combined with genetic algorithms, we guided the evolution of 50 volumetric solutions. The exponential increase in information requires new methodologies (Schwab, 2018). Results show the potential of computational methodologies to produce extensive urban solutions. This research, developed in a final graduation project in Architecture, aims at stimulating generative methodologies in undergraduate courses.

The experimental work of Antoni Gaudí and Frei Otto have been the precedents of what is currently called form-finding, a methodology based on rules and physical forces of nature that promotes principles of transformation as a result of the relationship between form, material and structure. This text shows the first results of the research titled as Form-finding methodology as strategy for formative research in industrial design education, with an empirical-analytical approach through action-research based method and using collaborative-participatory tools. As a result of the analysis of different cases in the first stage of the research, a basic methodological proposal is made, this methodological proposal is aimed to find new research possibilities for the identification of morphological characteristics to be used in design projects in the early creative phases (ideation and experimentation); the methodological proposal stages are the following: selection of technique, design of the experimentation, experimentation, analysis and discussion.

Increasing implementation of digital tools within a design process generates exponentially growing data in each phase, and inevitably, decision making within a design space with increasing complexity will be a great challenge for the designers in the future. Hence, this research aimed to seek potentials of captured data within a design space and solution space of a truss design problem for proposing an initial novel approach to augment capabilities of digital tools by artificial intelligence where designers are allowed to make a wise guess within the initial design space via performance feedbacks from the objective space. Initial structural design and modelling phase of a truss section was selected as a material of this study since decisions within this stage affect the whole process and performance of the end product. As a method, a generic framework was proposed that can help designers to understand the trade-offs between initial structural design alternatives to make informed decisions and optimizations during the initial stage. Finally, the proposed framework was presented in a case study, and future potentials of the research were discussed.

In this paper, we are aiming to present a methodology for generation, manipulation and form finding of structural typologies using variational autoencoders, a machine learning model based on neural networks. We are giving a detailed description of the neural network architecture used as well as the data representation based on the concept of a 3D-canvas with voxelized wireframes. In this 3D-canvas, the input geometry of the building typologies is represented through their connectivity map and subsequently augmented to increase the size of the training set. Our variational autoencoder model then learns a continuous latent distribution of the input data from which we can sample to generate new geometry instances, essentially hybrids of the initial input geometries. Finally, we present the results of these computational experiments and lay out the conclusions as well as outlook for future research in this field.

Dataflow parametric modeling environments have become popular as exploratory tools due to them allowing the variational exploration of a design by controlling the parameters of its parametric model schema. However, the nature of these systems requires designers to prematurely commit to a structure and hierarchy of geometric relationships, which makes them inflexible when it comes to design exploration that requires topological changes to the parametric modeling graph. This paper is a first step towards augmenting parametric modeling systems via the use of machine learning for assisting the user towards topological exploration. In particular, this paper describes an approach where Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural networks, trained on a data set of parametric modeling graphs, are used as generative systems for suggesting alternative dataflow graph paths to the parametric model under development.

Digital design tools are actually changing the way we design architecture, even if we never choose to use any software. This paper examines and proposes an initial design approach towards Computational Design Thinking for first-year architecture students, without the use of any parametric software. It investigates some of the main points of a Computational Design Thinking approach and then proposes a method for teaching design studios. The method refers to digital design tools / software we use as architects, introducing ways to manipulate physical form, almost the same way that digital design software manipulates digital models. Finally, the paper documents the outputs and evaluates the application of this method in teaching first year design studio in a UK university.

The structural education in architectural schools emphasize that the dialogue between professionals is what should be raised as the point of connection between the conception of the structural morphology to be carried out by the architect and its validation and construction by the structural engineer. However, is this dialogue occurring? The proposal of this work is to study the conversational model proposed by Paul Pangaro (2009), based on Gordon Pask's Conversation Theory (1976a), and investigate if in fact a dialogic process between architectural design and structures education in architectural schools occurs, or if there exist the possibility of proposing a new conversational model, promoting transdisciplinary participation and collaboration procedures.Please write your abstract here by clicking this paragraph.

There are a lot of discussions about digitalizing university teaching and opening it to civil society. In this context, we investigate the current options for setting up and distributing video-based online courses. First, we make a review of a subjectively selected set of existing platforms and technologies for video-based online courses. Next, we discuss the needs of futures online teaching concepts and the corresponding challenges of digitalization for university teaching. We summarize essential aspects of the considered platforms, technologies, and today's examples in tables. The main result is an overview of systems that can be used to start your online teaching initiative with a small budget

This paper describes the concept of the ``Experimental Bureau'' as a didactic environment aiming to deal with real-life design tasks within the framework of architectural education. Its main focus lies on the specific opportunities for digital empowerment of students who learn about the design process - sometimes even in the role of contractors - in real-life oriented project work. Thus the following questions come under scrutiny and discussion from an angle of work based learning: What kind of design problems are tackled in a meaningful way by students through the utilization of a digital strategy? What kind of software (or software mix) is chosen and what problems are addressed by the choice and handling of these digital tools? These questions are answered in a different way applying the format of the Experimental Bureau, driven by its real-life projects and client communication, in comparison to largely artificial tasks confined to the academic realm.

With the rapid increase in the accessible data, available information surpasses one's ability to extract knowledge from, which puts a great emphasis on the skills of the individual to reach and use relevant information, adapt to changing conditions and sustain respective skills. ICT skills, critical thinking skills, and communication/collaboration skills emerge as the survival skills and key factors for individuals to cope with the demands of the 21st-century. It is known that educational institutions have struggles in changing the curricula/teaching system in coping with the requirements of the rapidly evolving industry. Thus, workshops gained more importance in different levels which are a part of curricular or extracurricular activities to re-furnish existing skills or gain new skills. In the scope of this study, the learning and teaching approaches based on STEAM approach are assessed through a three-day workshop aiming to illustrate how these survival skills can be conveyed and embedded into the architecture education. The workshop is designed to be inclusive for all architecture students regardless of their level of education or background knowledge/skills. Within the scope of this paper, the conduction strategies of the workshop are covered in detail to highlight the importance of these survival skills along with the modes of teaching and share the best practices and gained knowledge for future works.

Starting with the first founded university, higher education has been evolving continuously, yet the pace of this evolution is not as fast as the changes that we observe in practice. Today, this discrepancy is not only limited to the content of the curricula but also the expected skills and competencies. It is evident that 21st-century skills and competencies should be much different than the ones delivered in the 20th-century due to rapidly developing and spreading new design and information technologies. Each and every discipline has been in continuous search of the ``right'' way of formalization of education both content and skill wise. This paper focuses on architectural design education incorporating discussions on the role of STEAM (Science Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics). The study presents the outcomes of the ArchiSTEAM project, which is funded by EU Erasmus+ Programme, with the aim of re-positioning STEAM in architectural design education by contemplating 21st-century skills (a.k.a. survival skills) of architects. Three educational modules together with the andragogic approaches, learning objectives, contents, learning/teaching activities and assessment methods determined with respect to the skill sets defined for 21st-century architects.

This study focus in design process that uses the digital environment in context of undergraduate courses of Architecture and Urbanism, mainly the Digital Architectural Design (DAD). From author's previous studies that classified the teaching practice in Latin America, the Brazilian data were analyzed due to its expressive and heterogeneous features. Faced with a scenario that points to institutional characteristics reflect in the teaching approach, a horizontal mapping was performed. A data cross-referencing through correlation methodology was carried out. As result, there is a prevalence of public institutions that use teaching practice using DAD, most of them located at South and Southeast with a close link between teaching and research.

The present paper is focused on exploring a new paradigm in architectural design process that should raise the bar for a mutual collaboration between humans and digital assistants, able to face challenging problems of XXI century. Such a collaboration will aid design process freeing designer from middle level reasoning tasks, so they could focus on exploring - on the fly - design alternatives at a higher abstraction layer of knowledge. Such an assistant should explore and instantiate as much as possible knowledge structures and their inferences thanks to an extensive use of defaults, demons and agents, combined with its power and ubiquity so that they will be able to mimic behaviour of architectural design human experts. It aims other than to deal with data (1st layer) and simple reasoning tools (2nd layer) to automate design exploring consequences and side effects of design decisions and comparing goals (3rd layer). This assistant will speed up the evaluation of fresh design solutions, will suggest solutions by means of generative systems and will be able of a digital creativity.

In this research we present a design for a mass customization online 3D model for deployable emergency shelter that automatically provides drawings for CNC machines. The main motivation for such research has risen from a global need to provide emergency shelters for people affected by natural disaster. The model is designed to be a flat packable, mono-material based on a double corrugated folding pattern. Based on numerous functional, structural and fabrication constraints the presented model can provide a myriad of similar geometric forms that can reflect personal needs and can be used for different purposes.

During the last decade, mass customization in developing countries has been rising. The combination of conventional methods and materials with computer numeric control technologies offers a possibility of merging established craftsmanship to the production of personalized components with mass production efficiency. This article aims to present the development of a facade component prototype as a means to prospect possibilities for mixing parametric design and digital fabrication to casting, especially in developing countries like Brazil. This is an applied research with an exploratory and constructive approach, which was a result of a graduate class structured on a research by design basis. The conceptual development and prototyping of the artifact followed iterative cycles, considering its performance, fabrication methods and feasibility. The selection of materials that are commonly used in Brazilian architecture, like concrete, facilitates the component adoption as as a facade solution. The main conclusion emphasizes the need of involvement between academia and industry for the development of innovative products and processes, and highlights different levels of mass customization to include a range of manufacturing agents, from major industries to local craftspeople.

In 2005, the rural housing deficit in Colombia was 1,600,000 units, which is equivalent to 68.25% of the total households. This very high number shows the difficulties faced by public policies on rural housing. This deficit is partly due to logistical problems related to the supply of materials and complexity in construction processes. It is necessary to explore new alternatives to offer more and better homes at lower costs. The research project presented in this manuscript started in 2013 as an initiative to reduce the housing deficit. It proposed to build a rural housing prototype integrating digital manufacturing processes. The performance of part of the structural and enclosing system was evaluated during a first iteration process to include changes in a second iteration later. With the adjustments to the design process discussed here, the prototype is expected to be built and tested to measure its efficiency and functioning.

This paper presents a novel method based in Multi-Agent Based Simulation (MABS), Cloud Computing, and the combination of big data analytics and IoT. The method performs in two layers: it assists designers with information coming from previews of projects and surroundings, and, it automates some procedures according to parameters and interactions between agents. The first part of this paper briefly describes the state of the art and challenges of the real estate market. The second chapter highlight gaps and future challenges in design practice, and in the third chapter, it introduces the method. To conclude, in the last part, this concept is analyzed through a pilot project under development in our institution.

The material-based studies examine through computation and physical prototyping layered composites for thermal responsive building envelopes. Focus is placed on surveying and computing a large series of materials across four groups, for then to test these materials from factors of solar energy reception capacities, internal heating methods, heat isolation coatings and layer bonding. An oak-polyethylene structure is developed based on the first studies and further tested towards implementation as part of an adaptive envelope demonstrator, with these studies focused on fabrication and assembly methods. Results of the developed, tested and applied composite as part of an adaptive envelope shows that the environmental-material composite is strongly influenced by colour and direct solar radiation exposure. This in turn allow a material-fabrication approach to program a responsive system driven by exergy. Reinforcing the responsive reaction of the composite by internal heating does not advance the performance, as coatings are needed to maintain the heat inside the material, which adds weight and isolate the composite from the thermal environment that otherwise is intended to provide the energy for driving the responsive behaviour.

This paper proposes a new workflow between design and fabrication phases through the introduction of a novel framework centered around a stylus that is tracked in real-time for five-axis by a single RGB-D camera. Often misconceived as a linear process, urgent reinterpretation of design and fabrication tools is discussed briefly. Similar to how industrial robots have become an enabler for fabrication process in the field of architecture and construction, the necessity for providing a similar tool that would reform the ``design'' process is underlined. A generic stylus is proposed with interchangeable operations which allows for intuitive, non-obstructive grasp of the user serves as the physical avatar that transform into a virtual representation of a fabrication tool mounted on a six-axis industrial robot arm. User interaction with the apparatus is simulated for the user, and the user is notified of any errors as the interaction is translated for motion planning of a KUKA KR20-3 industrial robot.

BIPV is a building integrated photovoltaic power generation system, which is used for building finishing materials, roof, and wall, so there is no need for separate installation space, and the usability is continuously increasing in urban areas with relatively small installation space. And continues to increase. BIPV is a building-integrated type, but the application plan should be made from the early stage of design. However, there is a lack of BIPV related design information. As a result, the possibility of integrating BIPV and building design is reduced and BIPV is applied in a limited range. Method: BIM-based BIPV design process, BIPV installable location, BIPV elevation design factor. And the theory necessary to implement the support model. Lastly, usability was examined using the support model. Result: This study describes a BIM-based design support model for BIPV installed elevation design that designers can apply BIPV installation location planning and design in a BIM environment.,

This paper is the result of a pedagogic proposal applied to undergraduate students of architecture in order to present new digital design tools and methods. This study aims to connect procedural contents to different design strategies enrolled by students with special focus on complex geometries. The objective was to offer the necessary assistance to an appropriated design development, by reducing the habitual mishaps related to the lack of technical skills with digital tools for both the design reasoning and the subsequent graphic representation of proposals. As an answer, a new design approach called A-BIM (Algorithmic-based Building Information Modeling) was introduced to students, which integrates BIM platforms with algorithmic modelling software allowing, in this way, some formal flexibility allied to an adequate graphic documentation.

The early stages of building design are characterized by a continuous endeavor for the development of variants and their evaluation and consistent detailing. The concept of adaptive detailing aims to enable the architect to evaluate and compare design variants which are partially incomplete and vague (Zahedi and Petzold 2018b). This paper discusses a minimized communication protocol based on BIM, which enables computer-readable interactions between the architect and different domain-experts (representing various analysis and simulation procedures) (Zahedi and Petzold 2018a). This comprises the selection of simulation procedures as well as any necessary consolidation of the information content according to the requirements of the simulations. Any additions required on the part of the simulation procedures are visually prepared globally or space-and component-oriented respectively, in order to perform detailing of a building model in a targeted way. Moreover, this paper proposes various supportive methods for visual representation and exploration of analysis results.

The continuous housing shortage demands efficient ways of design and construction. In the context of rising construction standards and shrinking manpower, one of the possible answers to the problem is prefabrication oriented towards do-it-yourself (DIY) construction methods, which could contribute to the low and middle income housing supply in the market. The article covers the process of developing an experimental tool for aiding single-family housing design with the use of small-element solid timber prefabrication, suitable for DIY assembly. The presented tool uses the potential of BIM technology adapting a traditionally-designed house to the needs of prefabrication and optimizing it in terms of waste generated in the assembly process. The presented experiment was realized in the Autodesk Revit environment and incorporates custom generative scripts developed in Dynamo-for-Revit. The prototype analyzed an input model and converted it into a prefabricated alternative based on the user- and technology-specified boundary conditions. The prototype was tested on the example design of a two-story single-family house. The results compare the automated optimized model conversion with manual adaptation approach. The implemented algorithm allowed for reducing the construction waste by more than 50%.

We present a Blockchain collaboration mechanism on optimisation problems between distributed participants who work with building information modelling tools. The blockchain mechanism is capable of executing smart contracts, acting as a reward mechanism of independent designers attempting to collaborate or compete on optimising a design performance problem. Earlier work has described the potential integration through different levels of Computer Aided Design and Blockchain. We present an expanded version of that integration and we showcase how a team can collaboratively and competitively work, using BIM tools, through the blockchain. The original contribution of the paper is the use of the design optimisation performance as a consensus mechanism for block writing in blockchains. To accomplish that we introduce mechanisms for BIM to Blockchain Integration but also describe a special category of blockchains for architectural design and the built environment. The paper concludes with an analysis of the relationship between trust and values as encapsulated in the blockchain and how these could affect the design collaboration.

More and more sectors are entering Industry 4.0 but when we look around in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry, we do not see it happening. We wanted to investigate the reason behind this. Therefore, we conducted research among Hungarian design studios to find out what level of development they are at, and what the obstacles could be for implementing the latest technologies. This paper identifies the main problem we uncovered and discusses a possible solution. We explain what BIM Organisation Development is and why it is fundamental for architect studios who would like to enter Industry 4.0. We introduce the so-called Brick+Data Method, specifying its three essential development steps to get BIM technologies implemented and to make architect studios more efficient. Finally, we share our findings according to the feedback of the companies we worked with using this method.

This paper presents and discusses the partial results of ongoing research on the development of computer applications connected to Building Information Modeling (BIM) software, aiming at the participation of non-technical actors in decision-making processes for public facilities projects. The research proposes the construction of a web-based application in which remote collaboration between technicians and non-technicians can be carried out in architectural design processes. The article points to the relevance of such cooperation in newly industrialised countries, reviews the key features of BIM, and presents the application currently under development. The paper focuses the theoretical discussion and characterisation of relationships between the involved parties and the practical implications of these reflections on the structure and design of the application. This research work is underway at the research group Nomads.usp of the University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil, and expects to contribute to the formulation and implementation of public policies in the sectors involved.

In the era of The Second Digital Turn, designers and engineers have easy and equal access to computational tools across the globe. With the highest development of technology at a global level, design development to construction process is locally contextualised in different parts of the world based on the available technology and resources. The paper presents a craft-based approach to computation and its contribution to support artisans' development in India. It is demonstrated through ongoing research on customising bricks and utilization of computationally generated asymmetrical Catalan vault. The challenge of constructing the computationally generated form by architecture students is completed by the craftsmen and students of crafts school. The research elucidates gaps at various levels. Craft based solutions bridging these gaps establish a methodology which makes complex geometry constructible in present-day India when access to digital fabrication methods are still evolving and expensive.

In the context of the fourth industrial revolution, not all regions have the same access to technology for project development. These technological limitations do not necessarily result in worst projects and, on the contrary, can stimulate creativity and human intervention to overcome these shortcomings. We report here the design of a small pavilion with scarce budget and an ambitious goal to qualify a space through tactical urbanism. We develop the project in a multidisciplinary partnership between academy and industry, designing, manufacturing and assembling Tornado Pavilion, a complex structure using combined HIGH-LOW technologies, combining visual programming with analog manufacture and assembly. The design strategy uses SIMPLEXITY with ruled surfaces strategy to achieve a complex geometry. Due to the lack of automated mechanical cutting or assembly, we used human expanded abilities for the construction; instead of a swarm of robots, we had a motivated and synchronized swarm of students. The pavilion became a reference for local population that adopted it. This process thus shows that less or almost nothing (Sola-Morales 1995), need not to be boring (Venturi 1966) but less can be much more (Kolarevic 2017).

The idea of a network weaved this project in a conceptual as well as in a physical way. A network in the sense of an intangible connection between people, and a network in the sense of a materiality, woven to constitute the skin of a building according to different techniques associated with the ancient culture of covering to provide shelter. We seek to integrate old cultural identities with new digital methods. In the time of the fourth industrial revolution, we might think about a network as something fully accomplished, as if the availability of an internet connection was synonymous with effective communication. In our methodology, we face network challenges at the intersection of human communication and the physical and material domains. The challenge is to discover what to exchange and how to do so. Through the Brazilian-German program `Connect', we tested our research in two practical workshops in two continents. The result suggests that is possible to weave a network incorporating local building traditions and analogue and digital processes of form-finding. The report describes our findings and shares critical reflections opening future research possibilities.

Towards an Architecture of Collaborative Objects, explores the potential of playing with Collaborative Objects in real, augmented and mixed realities. A multi-player game platform App: VoxelCO, developed by the author, provides a speculative playground to research, the interaction with objects, things and people, as well as provokes new opportunities to engage deeply with its content and context. Furthermore, VoxelCO, reveals new modes of participation, to design and collaborate in real-time with augmented reality, using millennial tools: mobile devices. A case study project, the VoxelStage, offered an opportunity to apply VoxelCO to design a stage together with a group of students. To merge the collaboratively aggregated virtual objects of VoxelCO with reality, real WireCubes were augmented and assembled, proposing an architecture of socially augmented fuzzy formations.

This paper reports a case involving computational practices in design process with an aim to understand the role of digital and non-digital tools in the design process. Following an ethnographic approach, we aimed at understanding the nature of the interactions among team participants which are human and non-human in a distributed system. We focused on computational practices in design process and we aimed to understand the role of digital and non-digital tools in the design process. Tools have remarkable role in a distributed system in the sense of propagation of knowledge. It was observed that form exploration by digital tools may not controlled as much as sketching.

Even though the computer acts as an effective interface for the cooperation of various actors involved in the construction, the success of a project depends crucially on the socio-cultural characteristics and disciplinary boundary conditions of the people involved. In addition to the technological challenges of digitisation, different working methods, requirements and objectives often represent an obstacle to the successful cooperation and execution of architectural projects. This is where we as a university are challenged to point out new ways that are geared to the future requirements of our professions and, as it were, integrate individual professional profiles. Against this background, the cooperative education project brought together architecture students and trainees in the carpentry trade in order to help them gain an understanding for their respective differing approaches and for their own expertise at an early stage in training, and thus experience the added value of a cooperative working method. The teaching of digital design and planning methods as well as the use of computer-aided production technologies were the vehicles for networked cooperation and integrative learning.

This paper introduces and discusses the first outcome of a recently created digital fabrication laboratory at Favela da Maré, a slum in the North zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The lab called FavLab is a partnership between the João e Maria Aleixo Institute, located inside Favela da Maré, and the Department of Architecture and Urbanism of PUC-Rio University. More specifically, it aims to present the lab's first activity: a workshop devoted to create and fabricate meaningful objects to the context of favela exploiting digital design and fabrication methods. Architecture undergraduates and local young residents not enrolled in the educational system participated in the studio. This paper aims to discuss in details the experience of teaching for this particular group of students, as well as the impacts of the collaborative design between university and favela students to create interactive objects in a Brazilian community. The paper aims to reinforce and remark an innovative and inclusive approach to digital design and fabrication. This paper also attempts to discuss further developments and next steps towards more profound and broader collaboration between academia and favelas' representatives.

This paper describes a recent make-a-thon event to engage architecture students with physical computing systems while working with engineering and entrepreneurship students. Focusing on the scale of the object or device, the pedagogical goals were to create a productive, transdisciplinary exchange--a pluralistic blend of design charrette, engineering hackathon, and entrepreneurial pitch competition. The Arduino platform and active learning methods were deployed in order to engage with a novice, diverse group of students, leading to outcomes that were responsive to the ever-shifting technological landscape and could be spun into future commercial ventures.

This is an exploratory study that had the purpose of understanding how Building Information Modeling (BIM), parametric design and digital fabrication are adopted in Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) design processes and how they unfold through and influence its stages and activities. Questionnaires and interviews were performed with professionals from or with previous experiences in firms considered to be early adopters of digital technologies in practice. Results suggest that the addressed digital technologies have complementary functions and can improve each other's potentialities when integrated in design process' stages. Their performance can also be improved when achieving a more holistic process, embracing constant feedback loops through parties involved and design solutions throughout its stages. In order to have this approach in overall AEC industry, many transformations are needed and some of them were also pointed out in this study

Questioning the importance and impact of design thinking methodologies in the architectural design studios is a backbone of architectural education in twenty first century. 3D printing and digital manufacturing are disruptive technologies that are changing architects and designers daily lives. These trends require new skills, based on a deep understanding of digital continuum from design to production, from generation to fabrication. This continuity transcends the merely instrumental contributions of a person-machine relationship to praxis, has begun to evolve as a medium that supports a continuous logic of design thinking and making. Design thinking methodologies associated with digital fabrication emerged as a leading technological and design issue of digital research and design. As designers, we are witnessing a no frontier between computational design and digital fabrication. For this paper is taken into consideration the work of two architecture studios that share a unique background on new methodologies by embracing the digital technology in their own practice. Their work reflects on new design methodologies facing the expansion of digital technology in architectural practice. This paper discusses the possibility of new design thinking methods driven by digital fabrication.

This paper presents a critical analysis and reflection on stereotomy with the purpose of updating its theoretical discourse. Having risen to the apex of architecture technological possibilities in the 17th century, stereotomic construction lost its importance in favour of iron, steel and other materials and construction techniques brought by the Industrial Revolution. More recently, much owing to the possibilities offered by digital technologies, a resurgence of interest in the subject has spawned various researches which bring stereotomy back to the architectural discourse. Although technological applications and design innovations in service of stereotomy have developed in multiple interesting paths, there is a lack of a common theory on the subject which is capable of relating these multiple apparently diverging stereotomic approaches between each other and, maybe even more importantly, to the classical practice which sparked the development this discipline. The research presented in this paper shows how the digital tools were instrumental in bringing this tradition to architecture contemporaneity and how a current stereotomy is largely supported by these technologies, while keeping strong relations to its classic origin.

This paper analyses how architecture became a pioneer discipline in digital interactivity research. It describes how that pioneer research derives from a lineage of researchers whose work spans more than two decades beginning in the early fifties. Military funds enabled the creation of the first computer graphic interfaces that evolved into a ``drawing machine'', the first interactive CAD, that made possible the role of architecture as a pioneering discipline in interactivity research. It is expected to demonstrate that the same architecture that nowadays uses mainly interactive digital design was one of first disciplines to research interactivity addressing a gap in the study of the link between architecture and interactivity.

Being in tune with the joint eCAADe and SIGraDi conference, this paper systematizes and analyzes data related to the set of papers presented in the history of the conferences of both societies. Which paths traced from eCAADe and SIGraDi brought us to the ``architecture in the age of the fourth industrial revolution''? This paper describes a bibliometric study focused on eCCADe and SIGraDi papers from 2003 to 2018 retrieved from CumInCad by using an open source software developed by the team for this research. The most used keywords and most cited authors, cross-citations between societies and time series about this data were synthesized, recovering part of the histories of these societies. Some similarities and differences between them are pointed out allowing to understand their past for better drawing their future.

During the last years, insertion of technology accelerates its incursion both in the design process and in the teaching-learning process. Design education has gone through different visions: Some hold the vision of education in design with a look at professional training. Others, have chosen to study the roots and problems of the training process, the ultimate goal is to generate experts in future designers. An element that - consistently - is often absent from such discussions is the role played by prototypes in the teaching-learning process. This research reviews the role that the prototype has played, as a central element, in the process of collecting evidence, with a view to informing the decision making during the development of Project Design. The paper discusses the role that prototypes - from the standpoint of CoDesign, Evidence Design, and evolutionary design - have played in the teaching experiences of the last four semesters within a Computer Lab for students of Industrial Design. The systematization of information extracted from the research experiences has evolved from the Lab model to the Maker-space experience.

This study argues that analysis of written content might be helpful to provide clues at a certain extent on the future directions of current research areas and the emergence of new study areas. In the scope of the study, the International Journal of Architectural Computing (IJAC) which has been a scientific platform covering many pioneer publications on education research in computer-aided architectural design (CAAD) field was selected as source content. Although the size of the source domain is limited, the analysis of abstracts and titles of 439 articles published in IJAC between 2003 and 2018 revealed promising results which can be examined under four characteristics: ``constant'', ``emerging'', ``fading'' and ``solidifying'' concepts. The tokens in the analysis process are words, phrases, topic nodes and links between topic nodes. The outcomes of this study might contribute to tracking the evolution of concepts their emergence or disusage in different time and contexts, and interrelations between different concepts.

This paper approaches the literature that combines the fields of Architectural Computing and Architecture and Urbanism produced in Latin America during the first two decades of the 21st Century. The main objective is to map the advancement of Digital Technology in Architecture and Urbanism in the context of the Third Industrial Revolution, in order to identify perspectives towards a Fourth Industrial Revolution. As methodology was applied a chronological survey of the literature produced in book format, predominantly printed in the 21st Century by Latin Americans researches in leading digital themes. At last, it can be verified that the production is still very scarce and still has not incorporated, in a significant way, the themes related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Today, architectural models are an important tool for illustrating drawn-on plans or computer-generated virtual models and making them understandable. In addition to the conventional methods for the manufacturing of physical models, a wide range of processes for Direct Digital Manufacturing (DDM) has spread rapidly in recent years. In order to facilitate the application of these new methods for architects, this contribution examines which technical and economic results are possible using 3D printed architectural models. Within a case study, it will be shown on the basis of a multi-storey detached house, which kind of data preparation is necessary. The DDM of architectural models will be demonstrated using two widespread techniques and the resulting costs will be compared.

Additive manufacturing (AM) is vastly developing across the industrial landscape and has recently expanded outside of the traditional polymeric and metallic-based materials. Ceramics are an ever-present material in the architectural field, but there has been minimal evolution in its associated manufacturing processes. The limitations of additive manufacturing of ceramics are quickly evolving and will soon create new potentials for architectural products and applications. This paper offers an overview of these limitations that are tested and examined through a case study.

This paper introduces a series of design and fabrication tests directed towards the use of bendable 3D printing materials in order to simplify a foam bubble-based geometry as a frame structure for modular assembly. The aspiration to reference a spittlebug's bubble cocoon in nature for a light installation in the urban context was integrated into a computational workflow conditioning light-weight, material-, and cost savings along with assembly-simplicity. Firstly, before elaborating on the project motivation and background in foam structures and applications of 3D-printed thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) material, this paper describes the physical nature of bubble foams in its relevant aspects. Subsequently this is implemented into the parametric design process for an optimized foam structure with Grasshopper clarifying the need for flexible materials to enhance modular feasibility. Following, the additive manufacturing iterations of the digitally designed node components with TPU are presented and evaluated. Finally, after the test assembly of both components is depicted, this paper assesses the divergence between natural foams and the case study structure with respect to self-organizing behavior.

The present paper describes a research that explores the design and production of customised architectural ceramic components defined through parametric relations of biomorphic inspiration and to be built through additive manufacturing. In this sense, is presented a case study that develops a system of both architectural and structural components - a column system. The definition process of the system is mediated by computational design, implementing not only structural analysis and optimization strategies, but also mimetic formal characteristics of nature to an initial grid, creating a model that adapts its formal attributes, depending on its assumptions and the material constraints. This process resulted in the definition of a set of solutions that better answer to a specific design problem.

As the field of 3D printing technologies expand, complex materials that require a deeper engagement, due to their more unstable properties, are of increasing interest. Cementitious composites, clays and other ceramic materials are of particular relevance: their potential for fast large-scale fabrication and local availability position these technologies at the forefront of expansion for 3D printing. Despite the extensive benefits inherent to clays, their irregularities and the largely unpredictable deviations that occur when printing from a digital model, currently limit design and architectural-scale applications. However, these deformations could conversely be harnessed as design generators, opening up avenues for both aesthetic and functional exploration. The paper presents an investigation into the inherent material instabilities of the clay 3D printing process for the development of an architectural masonry facade system. Through an iterative process based in craft, a new capacity for material expression and authenticity beyond previous manufacturing capabilities can become actualized.

The use of Additive Manufacturing (AM) for the production of architectural components has more and more examples attesting the possibilities and the advantages of its application. At the same time we seen a fast grow of the usage of ceramic materials to produce fully customised architectural components using Layer Deposition Modelling (LDM) [1] techniques. However, the use of this material, as paste, leads to a series of constraints relative to its behaviour when in the viscous state, but also in the drying and firing stages. Thus, when ceramic dries, the retraction effects may be a barrier to the regular use of this material to build future architectural systems. In this sense, it is important to study the material behaviour and know how to control and use it as a primary construction material. To do that we present the challenges and outcomes of project Hexashade, a ceramic vault shading system prototype whose geometry and internal structure is defined according to the solar incidence. This paper explain how we expect to build a real scale self-supporting prototype

The following article extends and tests computational methodologies of design to consider Finite Element Analysis in the creation of optimized infill structures based on regular and semi-regular patterns that comply with the geometrical constraints of deposition. The Stress-Deformation relationship manifested in Finite Element Analysis is structured in order to influence the geometrical arrangement of the complex spatial infill. The research presents and discusses a program of performance informed infill design, and validates the generalizability of a method of internalizing and automating Finite Element Method (FEM) processing in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) workflows, and tests manufacturability of the methods through its ability to handle the FDM process constraints of FEM influenced intricate geometries.

The topic `Digital Modern' is a metaphor for expressing the importance of the valorization of Modernism in the current stage of capitalism and in the context of the 4th Industrial Revolution, marked also by the inclusion of the virtual/digital in architecture design, ``towards a new materiality''. Linking, past, present and future, this paper aims to discuss the importance of documentation of the most emblematic modern works of Fortaleza, capital of Ceará (Brazil), using digital technologies, such as the BIM platform and 3D printing, with the goal of contributing to the valorization of memory and conservation of this important architectural heritage.

This paper focuses on a game on architectural heritage, possibilities for using gamification for conveying information through the reanimation of an ancient city. It proposes an immersive AR game involving the portrayal of cultural heritage through mobile devices. The game includes an AR application for Android devices which enabled rendering of 3D content in combination with camera input. This application is an independent game, tracking targets through GPS on a larger scale and using object recognition on a smaller scale. Our research aims to propose implementing game mechanics on an AR system at an archaeological site in order to increase visitors' interest, and promote the dissemination of cultural heritage.

Beijing Siheyuan is a type of Chinese vernacular housing with significant cultural value. During recent decades of economic growth, many Siheyuan houses have been destroyed; preserving the few remaining ones have become a necessity. Based on a historical analysis of their design principles, this paper develops a parametric model capable of representing its known variants. Our findings include a useful design tool able to efficiently represent existing or lost housing types and thus contribute to our understanding of the typology and their preservation.

In this paper, mid-century modern single-family houses designed by William Hajjar are analyzed through a shape grammar methodology within the context of the traditional architecture of an American college town. A member of the architecture faculty at the Pennsylvania State University, Hajjar was a practitioner in State College, PA, where the University Park campus is located, and an influential figure in the history of architecture in the area. The residential architecture he designed for and built in the area incorporates many of the formal and functional features typical of both modern European architecture and traditional American architecture. Based on a computational methodology, this study offers an investigation into this hybridity phenomenon by exploring Hajjar's architecture in relation to the traditional American architecture prevalent in the college town of State College.

Simulating human movement and actions in historical spaces/landscapes is a complex task. It requires not only the recreation of spaces that no longer exist, but more challenging the recovery of actions performed in the past. These actions can provide insights into important aspects such as how people inhabited, used, perceived, lived, sensed, and shaped these spaces. This research aims to show a framework to approach studying human movement, using an Agent Based Modeling (ABM) system. Our ABM tool has methods for creating, managing, and choreographing the movement of agents through 3D models. A number of iterative tests, both agent-to-agent and agent-to-model, enable the system to produce scholarly quantitative data in historical spaces. We highlight the use of this system through two case studies, one at an architectural scale and the other at landscape scale.

This paper is part of ongoing research which aims is to develop the methodology for the church heritage digitization and visualization. The subject of the presented work is the iconostasis, as a significant part of the Christian Orthodox church heritage, distinguished by its bilateral character, as an architectural element of a church interior and an art piece composed of icons. Considering that iconostases can be seen only in situ, we developed the methodology for its digitization and virtual representation dissemination, which provides a user with the possibility to visualize iconostases outside the physical borders of sacral interiors. The proposed methodology relies on techniques for photogrammetric surveying, 3D modeling, and augmented reality visualization, and it is presented in a particular case study of the iconostasis. An outcome is shown as the multimedia presentation of an exhibition, realized throughout collaboration between the university and the museum.

The present research is mainly focused on the development of a system that would be able to offer the potentiality of constructing free-form surfaces by using developable surfaces. Through a deep revision of pre-computational traditional geometric systems based on the classical Descriptive Geometry, after a re-interpretation that design and algorithmic generation tools allow by using computers and digital fabrication hardware as testing ground, a geometric control process has been designed in order to offer the possibility of managing double-curvature complex forms and their adaptation by using developable surfaces. The focal point of this system is proving how developable surfaces are suitable to build architectonical elements at real scale.

This paper is a take on contemporary works in wood designed with parametric softwares and seen from an academic and professional point of view. The knowledge about digital wood developed through Digital Fabrication Laboratories has proved to be effective but with certain limitations when used for real constructions. In fact, translating the freedom of building temporary architectures -which is usually one of the ``learn by doing'' activities of design studio or workshops- into wood architecture that respect all the constraints of real construction is a challenge. This paper shows several experiences where innovative ideas developed through research have been applied to temporary pavilions and real constructions in Japan, Italy and France.

Reciprocal Frame (RF) is a constructive system typically applied with timber, since it is composed by discrete elements with short dimensions. It allows the construction of large spans and complex geometries. This kind of structure has been addressed by recent research projects that aim to produce it using computational tools and digital fabrication techniques. Moreover, the enhancement of these technologies enabled the integration of simulations of biological processes into the design process as a way to obtain better and optimal results, which is known as Biomimetics. This paper describes the development of a spatial structure that combines the principles of RF and the assembly process of natural agents, such as birds, in a digital environment. The tools used for the generation of the structure were Rhinoceros, Grasshopper and different add-ons, such as Culebra, Kangaroo, Pufferfish and Weaverbird.

MeasureIt-ARCH is A GNU GPL licensed, dimension, annotation, and drawing tool for use in the open source software Blender. By providing free and open tools for the reading and editing of architectural drawings, MeasurIt-ARCH allows works of architecture to be shared, read, and modified by anyone. The digitization of architectural practice over the last 3 decades has brought with it a new set of inter-disciplinary discourses for the profession. An attempt to utilise `Open-Source' methodologies, co-opted from the world of software development, in order to make high quality design more affordable, participatory and responsible has emerged. The most prominent of these discussions are embodied in Carlo Raitti and Mathew Claudel's manifesto `Open-Source Architecture' (Ratti 2015) and affordable housing initiatives like the Wikihouse project (Parvin 2016). MeasurIt-ARCH aims to be the first step towards creating a completely Open-Source design pipeline, by augmenting Blender to a level where it can be used produce small scale architectural works without the need for any proprietary software, serving as an exploratory critique on the user experience and implementations of industry standard dimensioning tools that exist on the market today

As a contextual and passive design strategy, solar envelopes play a great role in determining building mass based on desirable sun access during the predefined period. With the rapid evolution of digital tools, the design method of solar envelopes varies in different computational platforms. However, current approaches still lack in covering the detailed complex geometry and relevant information of the surrounding context. This, consequently, affects missing information during contextual analysis and simulation of solar envelopes. This study proposes a subtractive method of solar envelopes by considering the geometrical attribute contained in the point cloud of TLS (terrestrial laser scanner) dataset. Integration of point cloud into the workflow of solar envelopes not only increases the robustness of final geometry of existing solar envelopes but also enhances awareness of architects during contextual analysis due to consideration of surface properties of the existing environment.

The use of mixed reality (MR) for landscape simulation has attracted attention recently. MR can produce a realistic landscape simulation by merging a three-dimensional computer graphic (3DCG) model of a new building on a real space. One challenge with MR that remains to be tackled is occlusion. Properly handling occlusion is important for the understanding of the spatial relationship between physical and virtual objects. When the occlusion targets move or the target's shape changes, depth-based methods using a special camera have been applied for dynamic occlusion handling. However, these methods have a limitation of the distance to obtain depth information and are unsuitable for outdoor landscape simulation. This study focuses on a dynamic occlusion handling method for MR-based landscape simulation. We developed a real-time semantic segmentation system to perform dynamic occlusion handling. We designed this system for use in mobile devices with client-server communication for real-time semantic segmentation processing in mobile devices. Additionally, we used a normal monocular camera for practice use.

Smartphones have become an ordinary accompanier of our walks and created new modes of appropriation of public space. This study aims to research these modes by observing the altering visual attention and walking behavior of people using smartphones in public space, and in this way, to reveal the emergence of different types of post-flâneurs. In order to address these aims, 346 (195 females, 151 males) smartphone users were observed in a central public square in Ghent, Belgium for seven days in 10-minute time intervals. Each person's gender, age, number of accompanies and their dominant mode of smartphone usage(s) were identified. Afterward, each person's walking timeline was organized into seconds and coded according to their focus of visual attention in 24 different modes which grouped under the three gaze types; visual attention on the environment, on the environment through the smartphone screen, and on the smartphone screen. Results of the descriptive statistics, multivariate graph, and rhythm-based in-depth analysis show that different types of smartphone activities affect visual attention and speed differently. Different types of post-flâneurs such as navigators and photo takers were identified based upon their high percentage of visual attention on the environment and slower walking speed. The study also revealed the frequent presence of phone-walkers (who walk while only holding the smartphone) and smartphone zombies (who walk slowly and without attention to their surrounding) in public space. In addition to these, our research revealed rapid smartphone zombies who walk faster than the average walking speed, a finding contrary to the former studies reviewed.

This paper explores the development of design procedures in relationship to their digital proceedings, in order to interface human movement and parametric design procedures. The research studied the use of Leap Motion controller, a gesture recognition device using infrared sensors combined with time-based generative tools in Rhinoceros Grasshopper. A physical, artistic procedure was used as a reference to model a digital design procedure, including a series of parametric definitions combined with them in an attempt to produce complex three-dimensional designs in real time. In a later stage of this research, a modular, open source, digitizing arm was developed to capture hand movement and interact with an autonomous parametric definition, augmenting even more the range of applications of dexterity-based digital design. The challenge of this experimental investigation lies in the negotiation of the designer's needs for a complex yet open design process and the possibilities of defined soft- and hardware solutions.

This paper examines the potential of User Interfaces (UI) and sensor feedback to develop an intuitive design and fabrication process utilizing granular jamming. By taking advantage of the variable stiffness of granular jamming over time, an adaptive fabrication process is presented in which various structures are formed from individual jammed components which can weave or interlock in an overall system. A User Interface (UI) is developed as a design tool which would enable interactive design decisions and operations, based on pre-designed formal and tectonic strategies. The project has four research trajectories that are developed in parallel: (1) material system research; (2) development of an ad hoc digital recording system; (3) creation of a computational library that stores users` iterations; and (4) development of a User Interface (UI) that enables users' interaction with the computational library.

Visually impaired people represent a large amount of the Brazilian population. However, although a wide range of existing legislation ensures accessibility, most of the Brazilian public spaces are inadequate to accommodate disabled citizens. In this context, this paper presents a digital device, which combines the smartphone technologies with Arduino microcontrollers, for orientation and obstacle detection. We tested the minimum viable product and the first vest prototype through a user-centered usability test, which combines HCI assessments to other techniques, such as semi-structured interviews. As known, these wearable devices and mobile applications are in the center of the Internet of Things discussion. This study is expected to be an alternative for the urban mobility of visually impaired people, allowing them to have a more active and independent behavior in public spaces.

Carbon fiber composites embody lightweight and strength and is a well-integrated material in various fields of engineering. In spite of its excellent material properties, it is not frequently found in architecture and design applications. In this project, the intention is to research how the material's most prominent qualities can be applied to create a lightweight furniture design. The furniture object was chosen as an example of a small architectural component with a structural capacity of holding a human body weight between 60-90 Kg. In particular, carbon fiber composites display an impressive tensile strength, and with the aim of exploring this feature, a case-study of a full-scale, hanging carbon chair was conducted. To develop a design, optimize it and realize it, an integrated design and fabrication process was developed. It combined material research, computational design, and a novel fabrication method for filament materials.

We present a study of how parametric design can be linked to field experiments where ready-made plug-ins are not available for performative modelling. The study centres on prototyping `Singing Cans' - an experimental wind instrument made with an assembly of drinking cans that can produce sounds in recognizable pitches by interacting with airflows. We describe how field experiments conducted in a fluid flow lab can generate performative resources linkable to parametric design modelling. In Singing Cans, we focus on how to get airflow through a hole made on drinking can to make sounds. The prototyping process involved a lab-based calibration process to establish the relationship between the air volume of a can, measured by water-filling, and the pitch produced, measured by the Tuner Lite by Piascore. The field experiments resulted in a dataset capturing a can's sound-making behaviour in terms of water volumes and pitches. A parametric model that can take in wind data generated by a CFD package and output a 3D frame for site-specific cans installation is presented.

This paper describes two workshops raising awareness of the complexity of the interactions between digital and non-digital space, networks, devices, and systems. The exercises are included in broader research that deals with the human condition in the contemporary and future cities, focusing on the relationship between public space and weaponized data as a threat but also as an opportunity to act. A new way to understand and operate the street must be developed, with new epistemic assemblages, which allow us to avoid dystopian or technocratic visions in order to think collectively in our future human habitat. We offer here a toolkit, a series of strategies, to cope with the overwhelming complexity and act. The research is still open and the present paper shows the most recent experiences of a twenty-year journey.

Design strategies that employ digital and material imprecision to achieve esthetic innovation exhibit high potential to transform the current precision-oriented practices of computation and digital fabrication in architecture. However, such strategies are still in their infancy. We present a design method facilitating intentionally-imprecise esthetic explorations within the framework of digital design and robotic single-point incremental forming. Our method gives access to the esthetic fine-tuning of molds from which architectural objects are cast. Semi-precise computational operations of extending, limiting, deepening and shallowing the geometrical deformations of the mold through robot toolpath fine-tuning are enabled by a digital toolkit featuring parametric modeling, surface curvature analyses, photogrammetry, digital photography and bitmap image retouching and painting. Our method demonstrates the shift of focus from geometric accuracy and control of material behaviors towards intentionally-imprecise digital explorations that yield novel esthetic features of architectural designs. By demonstrating the results of applying our method in the context of an exploration-driven design process, we argue that imprecision can be equally valid to accuracy, opening a vast, excitingly unknown territory for material-mediated esthetic explorations within digital fabrication. Such explorations can interestingly alter the esthetic canons and computational design methods of digital architecture in the nearest future.

This paper presents intermediate results of an experimental research directed towards development of a method that uses additive manufacturing technology as a generative agent in architectural design process. The primary technique is to variate speed of material deposition of a 3D printer in order to produce undetermined textural effects. These effects demonstrate local variation of material distribution, which is treated as a consequence of interaction between machining parameters and material properties. Current stage of inquiry is concerned with studying the impact of these textural artefacts on structure. Experiments demonstrate that manipulating distribution of matter locally results in more optimal structural performance, it solves printability issues of overhanging geometry without the need for additional supports and provides variation to the surface. The research suggests aesthetic and structural benefits of applying the developed method for mass-customized fabrication. It questions the linear thinking that is predominant in the field of 3D printing and provides an approach that articulates interaction between digital and material logics as it directs the formation of an object that is informed by both.

The paper proposes an alternative way to present architectural information, using color filters - specifically RGB lenses - as an interface to emphasize or reveal the internal structure or hidden logic of an architectural artifact. In an interplay of analogue and digital techniques, it employs rules of color blocking in order to highlight certain aspects of complex buildings, urban plans, or interiors, which cannot be discovered using conventional visualization methods. In this research, the authors developed an interactive RGB lens-interface and techniques for superimposed color visualizations that can be used for an enhanced visualization of the internal structure of a building. By applying physical or digital color lenses, viewers can perceive individual layers of project visualizations, in order to understand certain tectonic or construction logics, such as skin, structure or infrastructure. Based on existing bibliography, the paper presents the workflow from drawing, 3D model or photograph to RGB visualization, through a series of test case scenarios applicable to the field of architecture and design.

This paper explores the use of smart technologies like physical computing with a sensor and an actuator, to create a prototype of a wearable technology, which augments our interaction with the environment, and people. The initial design idea was based on an empirical study of varying body heat signature patterns corresponding to emotions. However, we are interested to expand the discussion beyond technical issues in the design process, to reflect on the broader relationship of the human body with space and people. The study raises some important questions vis-à-vis current mobility and scalar reduction of Technology today: What is the relationship between architecture and the human body? Can a wearable technology be used to indicate, and express a fluctuating emotion? How would a traditional garment element evolve to respond to a new requirement or program?

This paper describes the color design process of the house in the village. The color design process proposed in this paper constitutes design stages such as color selection, color application, and color design analysis and evaluation. In the color selection step, a method of arranging colors using a color pallet or a color scheme is described. The color application stage includes the process of creating a village color design alternatives by specifying the color information of the hue, value, and saturation based on the BIM model. The color analysis stage is to numerically identify the color design attributes of the generated color design alternatives. The reason for color analysis and evaluation is to produce various design alternatives with the color harmony and improve the quality of the design

In this paper we approach the concept of grey box model to understand the subjectivity and objectivity of urban design. From the beginning of the insertion of computational systems in the systems management, we understand that some simulations and the understanding of the city itself were partial: we do not understand the city and its spatial complexity and we have the pretension to do urban design thinking that we understand the urban life . Here we will address some categories of how we can simulate and create our urban systems using a more tactile cybernetics.

This work is part of the interdisciplinary research project ``Mediations of augmented space: artifacts, interfaces and representations in artistic and design disciplines'', based at the Computing and Design Center of the Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Urbanismo of the Universidad Nacional del Litoral (Santa Fe, Argentina), and directed by PhD. Arch. María Elena Tosello. The work, which was developed in the framework of a grant directed by MSc. Arch. Griselda Bertoni, proposes to reflect on certain limitations that may affect the experience of public space, and how, through the integration of artifacts, interfaces and augmented public spaces, a better appropriation, mobility and habitability of cities can be promoted for seniors. The work seeks to make a creative contribution so that older adults can exercise the right to mobility and feel active citizens of society.

A common understanding exists that citizens should become more involved in the design, planning, and governance of the city. Due to a lack of common platforms and difficulties in the meaningful integration of the participatory input, however, the tools and methods currently employed in citizen engagement are often ill connected to the design and governance tools and processes used by experts. In this paper we describe a Grasshopper and Rhino based approach, which allows designers to share a subset of the design space formed by parametric design variants with citizens via the online interface Beta.Speckle. In a user study we evaluated the usability of the tool as well as studied the design choices of participants, which were found to be influenced by preferences for visual order and underlying economic, social, and environmental values. For the future design of participatory exercises, it was concluded that indicators relating to citizens' values and preferences will allow for a more effective exploration of the design space and increase the meaningfulness of results.

For the built environment's transformation we are confronted with complex dynamics connected to economic, ecologic and demographic change (Czerkauer-Yamu et al., 2013; Yamu, 2014). In general, cities are complex systems being a ``heterogeneous mosaic'' of a variety of cultures and functions, characterised by diverging perceptions and interests (ibid). The juxtaposed perceptions and interests in relation to ongoing spatial processes of change create a particularly complex situation. Thus, for planning processes we are in need of approaches that are able to cope not only with the urban complexity but also allow for participatory processes to empower citizens. This paper presents the approach of using Digital Twins in virtual reality (VR) for civic engagement in urban planning, enriched with quantitative and qualitative empirical data as one promising approach to tackle not only the complexity of cities but also involve citizens in the planning process.

Location-based mobile applications have been a rising theme for academics in the field of urbanism and in urban and transportation, because of the potential of transformation they might bring to the urban landscape (De Souza e Silva, 2013). One of the possibilities we study here is to observe social encounters fostered by commuting rides. In this paper, we try to examine the practice from the broad perspective of estimating the environmental benefits, in a context where digital information technology is wielded to address problems old and new (Townsend, 2014). This paper aims to analyze the potential of transformations that new ICTs bring to urban mobility, using as case study the official ridesharing system of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, the Caronaê project. The system was developed focusing on the reduction of the number of motorized trips to the University, as well as the amount of CO2 generated by them. Here we analyze the dynamics of ridesharing, using the system data, and also try to observe the role it may play towards the promotion of integration in the UFRJ community.

Little research has been made into the application of parametric urban design approaches to urban design in practice. On the part of urban design practitioners, lack of knowledge of parametric design, time constraints and a focus on day-to-day operations contribute to this situation. And on the part of parametric design researchers, lack of understanding of practice workflows, project types and media output types also contribute. The limited interaction between academia and practice in itself constitutes a barrier to changing the situation. This paper presents some first results from a research project aiming to overcome this barrier. The research design involves a theoretical framework for parameterising site design on the level of site layout, building forms and facade schemas. It also involves an analysis of typical workflows from urban design practice, as well as of the types of media which are typically used to present urban design projects.

This paper is based on the assumption that a key challenge of good design is spatial organization as a result of functional requirements. The authors present a new NetLogo application that assists designers in understanding proposed functional relationships (of spaces) by visualizing them graphically. In more detail, the tool translates adjacency matrices (as representation of functional relationships) into a graph (in architecture known as bubble diagram). The latter can be considered as a pre-step of the actual design, by which the information about functional interrelations becomes more readable and understandable for the designer.

The field of generative architectural design has explored a wide range of approaches in the automation of design production, but these approaches have demonstrated limited artificial intelligence. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a leading deep generative model that use deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn from a set of training examples in order to create new design instances with a degree of flexibility and fidelity that outperform competing generative approaches. Their application to generative tasks in architecture, however, has been limited. This research contributes new knowledge on the use of GANs for architectural plan generation and analysis in relation to the work of specific architects. Specifically, GANs are trained to synthesize architectural plans from the work of the architect Le Corbusier and are used to provide analytic insight. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of different augmentation techniques that architects can use when working with small datasets.

This paper aims to develop a case study for training an algorithm to recognize architectural drawings. In order to succeed that, the algorithm is trained with labeled pixel-based, architectural drawing (plan and section) dataset. During the training process, transfer learning (pre-training model) is applied. The supervised learning and convolutional neural network are utilized. After certain iterations, the algorithm builds awareness and can classify pixel-based plan and section drawings. When the algorithm is shown a section that is not produced with conventional drawing technic but through hybrid technics, it could predict the drawing class correctly with %80 of accuracy. On the other hand, some of the algorithm prediction is misoriented. We examined this prediction problem in the discussion section. The results illustrate that neural networks are successful in training algorithms to recognize and classify pixel-based architectural drawings. But for a highly accurate algorithm prediction, the dataset of the drawing images must be ordered, according to sample resolution, sample size and sample coherence for the dataset.

This paper proposes a fuzzy-based approach for the automated evaluation of spatial layout configurations. Our objective is to evaluate soft and interdependent design qualities (such as connectedness, enclosure, spaciousness, continuity, adjacency, etc.), to satisfy multiple and mutually inclusive criteria, and to account for all potential and logical solutions without discarding preferable, likely or even less likely possible solutions. Using fuzzyTECH, a fuzzy logic software development tool, we devise all possible spatial relation inputs affecting physical and non-physical outputs for a given space using descriptive rule blocks. We implement this fuzzy logic system on an existing residential space to evaluate different layout alternatives. We define all linguistic input variables, output variables, and fuzzy sets, and present space-space relations using membership functions. We use the resulting database of fuzzy agents to evaluate the design of the existing residential spaces.

The permeation of various fields by the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) has arrived in the collective consciousness and is increasingly present in the physical world. Current results of AI research in the field of architecture illustrate that already today within every step of the architectural conception and fabrication approaches towards their automation are being made. Even the very human features of motivation and creativity aren't left untouched anymore. This paper discusses, on the basis of different concepts and examples, up to what extent the contemporary possible implementations of AI and their underlying algorithms are able to conquer the architectural profession. Furthermore, it presents a summary of an automation-concept for the whole profession.

Refurbishments and adaptations to existing building structures can be a challenging problem: Keeping track of all building measures (e.g. what walls, doors and installations to add or remove) is equally demanding as trying to keep an eye on the constraints (e.g. natural lighting) and functions that the changed structure will provide. It also demands a integrated view of the redesign (spatial aspect) and the refurbishment as a project (time aspect). To this end, we have been developing our planning tool ``Refurb!'', which lets a user plan refurbishments and adaptations to existing structures using a mixed metaphor of ``CAD-tool + project plan'', including a variety of analysis tools to compare the original state of a structure to the planned one (e.g. adjacency and circulation before and after adaptation). The tool is aimed at project planners and ranges from small scenarios (e.g. relocation/adaptation/refurbishment of a department) to big scenarios (e.g. relocation when bringing a hospital into service).

In this study, we developed a method for generating omnidirectional depth images from corresponding omnidirectional RGB images of streetscapes by learning each pair of omnidirectional RGB and depth images created by computer graphics using pix2pix. Then, the models trained with different series of images shot under different site and weather conditions were applied to Google street view images to generate depth images. The validity of the generated depth images was then evaluated visually. In addition, we conducted experiments to evaluate Google street view images using multiple participants. We constructed a model that estimates the evaluation value of these images with and without the depth images using the learning-to-rank method with deep convolutional neural network. The results demonstrate the extent to which the generalization performance of the streetscape evaluation model changes depending on the presence or absence of depth images.

Mass Customization systems in architecture have yet to adequately address the problem of capturing physical context, a fundamental aspect of dealing with building renovation, which has limited their scope of application. Previous research has demonstrated that existing methods of capturing as-built plans of rooms by non-expert users do not produce sufficiently accurate results for digital fabrication. The present paper reports on research into the development of an algorithm for semi-automated survey of convex or non-convex rooms by building owners. The improved workflow is tested by expert and non-expert users in a to-be renovated building and the results are compared with existing methods of survey.

We present an approach for computer-aided generation of different variations of floor plans during the early phases of conceptual design in architecture. The early design phases are mostly characterized by the processes of inspiration gaining and search for contextual help in order to improve the building design at hand. The generation method described in this work uses the novel as well as established artificial intelligence methods, namely, generative adversarial nets and case-based reasoning, for creation of possible evolutions of the current design based on the most similar previous designs. The main goal of this approach is to provide the designer with information on how the current floor plan can evolve over time in order to influence the direction of the design process. The work described in this paper is part of the methodology FLEA (Find, Learn, Explain, Adapt) whose task is to provide a holistic structure for support of the early conceptual phases in architecture. The approach is implemented as the adaptation component of the framework MetisCBR that is based on FLEA.

This paper illustrates the synergy of non-manifold topology (NMT) and a branch of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) called reinforcement learning (RL) in the context of evaluating fire egress in the early design stages. One of the important tasks in building design is to provide a reliable system for the evacuation of the users in emergency situations. Therefore, one of the motivations of this research is to provide a framework for architects and engineers to better design buildings at the conceptual design stage, regarding the necessary provisions in emergency situations. This paper presents two experiments using different state models within a simplified game-like environment for fire egress with each experiment investigating using one vs. three fire exits. The experiments provide a proof-of-concept of the effectiveness of integrating RL, graphs, and non-manifold topology within a visual data flow programming environment. The results indicate that artificial intelligence, machine learning, and RL show promise in simulating dynamic situations as in fire evacuations without the need for advanced and time-consuming simulations.

The complexity of the wall form affects the acoustics of the space. In this study, the effect of the complex form walls produced by nCloth dynamic simulation on the acoustics of an office space was investigated. In this research, reverberation time and Speech Transmission Index (STI) values of the pilot office space with one wall having complex form and the office space with all of the walls as flat were measured by acoustic simulation. As a result of the comparison, it has been found that, within speech intelligibility and reverberation time, the acoustics of the space with one wall having complex form is better than the acoustics of the space with all the walls as flat.

This paper explores through professional case studies how design solutions produced by expert teams compares to those developed through systematic parametric analysis. While the expert intuition of either single designer or teams helps to rapidly identify relevant aspects of the design problem and produce viable solutions, it has limitation to address multi-criteria design problems with conflicting objectives and searching for design alternatives. On the other hand, parametric analysis techniques in combination with data analysis methods helps to construct and analyze large design spaces of potential design solutions. For the purpose of this study, the specifications of geometric features and material properties of the building envelopes proposed by the expert design teams define the base line to measure the extent of the performance improvements of two typically conflicting objectives: Daylight quality and energy consumption. The results show consistently significant performance improvement after systematic optimization.

Numerous studies on Space Syntax and Evidence-based Design explored occupancy and movements in the built environment using traditional methods for behavior mapping, such as observation and surveys. This approach, however, has majorly focused on studying such behaviors as aggregated results -totals or averages- to corroborate the idea that people's interactions are outcomes of the influence of space. The research presented in this paper focuses on capturing human occupancy with a high spatiotemporal data resolution of 1 sq.ft per second (0.1 sq.mt./s). This research adapts computer vision to obtain large occupancy datasets in a hospitalization setting for one week, providing opportunities to explore correlations among spatial configurations, architectural programs, organizational activities planned and unplanned, and time. The vision is to develop new analytics for building occupancy dynamics, with the purpose of endorsing the integration of a temporal dimension into architectural research. This study introduces the ``Isovist-minute''; a metric that captures the relationship between space and occupancy, towards a point of interest, in a dynamic sequence.

This study explores to what extent Agent Based Systems (ABS) can handle multi-criteria optimization problems. The implementation of ABS in the field of optimization has limitations to address multiple criteria in a continuous generation process due to ABS usually merge the perceived information in a single response. To address this limitation, we increase the responsiveness of the systems through a multiple production approach. This approach breaks down the problem into two parts: the configuration through the interactions of the agents, and the overall performance through their local decisions. The method is tested in a case study of the network circulations of a park, optimizing the slope, views and sun. Performance and differentiation capabilities are evaluated in populations generated in two different scenarios. Data analysis methods verify the effectiveness of the algorithm and quantify the influence of each parameter on the final results.

The paper presents research for wind-responsive architecture. The main objective is the digital design methodology incorporating the dynamic, fluctuating wind flow into the shape-generating process of architectural envelopes. These computational studies are advanced and informed through physical prototyping models, allowing a hybrid method approach. The negative impacts of the wind at the building scale (wind loads), as well as urban scale (wind discomfort), can be avoided and even transformed into an advantage by incorporating the local wind conditions to the process of creating architectural envelopes with adaptive structures. The paper proposes a tensegrity-membrane system which, when exposed to the dynamic wind flow, enables a local passive shape adaptation. Thus, the action of the wind pressure transforms the shape of the building envelope to an unsmoothed, dimpled surface. As a consequence, the aerodynamic properties of the building are modified, which contributes to reducing wind suction and drag force. Moreover, the slight shape change materializes and articulates the immaterial wind phenomena. For a better understanding of the dynamic geometric properties, one unit of the wind-responsive envelope is tested through simulations, and through physical prototypes. The idea and material-geometric studies are subsequently applied in a specific case study, including a designed building envelope in an industrial silo cluster in Stockholm.

In the quest to achieve the ambitious climate and clean energy targets the broad implementation of Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) is one of the keys. Photovoltaic (PV) modules can be installed above or on current roofing or traditional wall structures. In addition, BIPV devices substitute the skin of the exterior construction frame, i.e. the weather screen, thus simultaneously acting as both a climate screen and an energy producing source. However, while the integral planning strategy to building projects promotes the effective execution of BIPV, the limitation lies in the absence of both instruments and easy-to-use planning aid guidelines, particularly by non-PV experts in the early design stage. This study presents computational methods that help to quickly analyze the BIPV potential for a given building project and to suggest the optimal economical amount and location of the panels based on the building's energy demand profile.

The notion of design spaces (DS) can be understood as the potential of a parametric model, it is basically the number of possible combinations for its input parameters. When combining tools that produce these alternatives automatically with different simulation softwares, the concept of parametric analysis (PA) emerges. This implies a simultaneous evaluation of the alternatives as they are constructed by the parametric model, producing large amounts of information. This article describes a sectional approach to the management of this information and a visualization technique to represent it looking for correlations between the input parameters and their performance. Correlations that are fundamental to making decisions with confidence when design problems challenge traditional methods of decision-making based on heuristics and design expertise.

Consolidated urban areas usually present a challenge for the sustainable design decisions for the architect. The site, orientation and surrounding built environment compromise both passive and active systems, shortening the possible optimization measures available, leaving the designer with doubts as far as efficiency is concerned.BIM methodologies and visual programming languages have opened up a very wide range of design and analysis tools allowing the architect to make informed decisions based on data extracted from the models. Nonetheless it's optimization is through a slow process of trial and error, creating a significant limitation. This paper discusses the potentialities of the use of evolutionary algorithms to generate optimized solutions for facade solar orientation. A comparison between three different evolutionary algorithms aiming for solar radiation, inside average temperature allows to conclude the best result versus time consumed. Although under similar results the multi-objective EA represents the best compromise between time and final objective on the case study chosen for the paper. The interconnectivity in real time of BIM and algorithmic modeling softwares represents an advantage for time saving sustainable design decisions.

The technological breakthrough on photovoltaic facades and the high potential for installing photovoltaic (PV) systems in the city of Salvador are the motivation for this article. This case study explores the feasibility of implementing solar energy technology on a building facade, proposing a design method for optimizing insolation performance by the form-finding process in a parameterized shape. The goal was to generate a parametric design workflow, in which it could be found some facade shapes, generating triangle and quadrilateral supporting grids, leading to better results in the total amount of radiation in comparison to the basic flat facade. In these supporting grids were evaluated also the fitting in the distribution of quadrilateral commercial PV cells, measuring its geometric compatibility. By the results, it could be verified the gains and losses in PV potential in several instances obtained by the form-finding process, as the potentials to consider this in the design of every building.

Situated within the art of cutting solids (stereotomy) and the evolution of machine tools; this research will investigate subtractive fabrication in relation to robotic carving of stone structures. The advancement of the industrial revolutions in the mid to late 19th century saw the rise of new building techniques and materials which were primarily based on structural steel construction. The modern aesthetic of the time further diminished the place of traditional stonework and ornamentation in modern structures within the building arts. This paper will focus on the design and fabrication of three sculptural dry-stone modular prototypes investigating interlocking self-supporting structures in stone. Examining the value of robotic technologies in the design and construction process in relation to collaborative crafting of the hand and machine. Accommodating for material tolerances which are a major factor in this research. Interrogating the value of robotic crafting with material implications and exploring the role of the artisan in machine crafted architectural components.

This paper discusses the potential of emerging digital fabrication techniques to produce material-efficient thin folded concrete structures. Although in the 50s and 60s folded structures provided a common optimal solution for spanning large distances without additional vertical supports, today, the number of these projects decreased significantly due to their complicated formworks and labour-intensive realization. Digital fabrication methods for concrete hold the promise to efficiently produce intricate folded mass-customized shapes with enhanced load-bearing capacity. This paper focuses on a robotic slip-forming process, Smart Dynamic Casting (SDC), to produce various thin-walled folded concrete elements with the same formwork providing smooth surface finish and gradual variations along the height. An empirical research methodology was applied to evaluate the fabrication feasibility of digitally designed thin folded geometries with one-to-one scale prototypes. Despite the discovered design limitations due to fabrication and material constraints, the exploration led to a new promising research direction, termed `Digital Casting'.

Collaborative Robots, or Cobots, bring new possibilities for human-machine interaction within the fabrication process, allowing each actor to contribute with their specific capabilities. However creative interaction brings unexpected changes, obstacles, complexities and non-linearities which are encountered in real time and cannot be predicted in advance. This paper presents an experimental methodology for robotic path planning using Machine Learning. The focus of this methodology is obstacle avoidance. A neural network is deployed, providing a relationship between the robot's pose and its surroundings, thus allowing for motion planning and obstacle avoidance, directly integrated within the design environment. The method is demonstrated through a series of case-studies. The method combines haptic teaching with machine learning to create a task specific dataset, giving the robot the ability to adapt to obstacles without being explicitly programmed at every instruction. This opens the door to shifting to robotic applications for construction in unstructured environments, where adapting to the singularities of the workspace, its occupants and activities presents an important computational hurdle today.

This paper lays out a fabrication and simulation method for an adaptable and reusable moulding system for the production of fibre reinforced concrete elements. This research leverages soft robots and their computational controllability as means of a composite material and as such the base of a controlled and adaptable moulding system. This paper describes the development of this programmable material towards a functioning system for casting processes with fibre glass reinforced concrete. The controllable material allows to deploy target shapes and to eliminate supplementary falsework and the customized production of moulds for doubly-curved concrete elements. It also lays out a feedback method, which serves as adjustment tool of the simulation to the physical behaviour of the material as well as simulation method for target based geometries.

This paper presents a project-based research study using the beta version of Oriole-a custom-made animation-based plug-in for grasshopper 3D visual programming environment, to develop robotic motion/controlling solutions. Oriole, as a parametric tool, makes it possible for designers/users to ``design''-instead of generating, the motions of the robot based on the notion of keyframing and time-based animation. Through the use of Oriole, users can simulate-and ultimately develop robotic motions/performances in more intuitive ways. This unique feature enables users with minor or no programming background to create robotic solutions using Oriole as a software/plugin Bridge.Using Rhinoceros 3D as a digital modeling platform in conjunction with Grasshopper 3D and its robotic simulation platforms, Oriole can develop controlling strategies for different industrial robots such as KUKA, ABB, and Universal Robots. Oriole enables designers to create a precise interaction between the robot, its spatial ``performance'' and the physical environment, through animation and keyframing to ``design'' robotic interactions and movements as frames of animation instead of segments of a curve ``path.''

Project InFoamed Matter works with foam and explores the internal logic of the material and develops a construction system based on fluidity and expansion. The basic unit of the system consists of two elements, that continuously exchange their roles in the construction process - the frame (controlling element made of paper or, in later development, from glass or carbon fiber cured in epoxy resin) and the expander (filling element consisting of 2k polyurethane foam). The expander fills up voids within the frame. While initially only the frame plays crucial structural role within a system, the expander being a filling element, eventually the hardening process switches the roles, hardened expander being the structural core and the frame being a form-defining tool. In later development, fiber frame creates a composite together with hardened expander, being able to resist both tension and compression forces. Project further proposes computational model, which generates positions and orientations for placing further components as well as a robotic fiber laying, assembly and injection system, which leads to novel automated construction system based on material behavior.

Fabricating process with robotic awareness and creativity makes architect able to explore the new boundary between digital and material world. Although parametric and generative design method make diverse processing of materials possible for robots, it's still necessary to establish a new design-fabrication framework, where we could simultaneously deal with designers, robots, data, sensor technology and material natural characters. In order to develop a softer system without gap between preset program and robot's varying environments, this paper attempts to establish an environment-computer-robot workflow and transform traditional robotic fabrication from linear to more tangible and suitable for architects` and designers' intuitive motion and gesture. RAF (Robotic Aware Fabrication), a concept of real-time external enhancement fabrication is proposed, and a new workflow of HARF (Hand-motion Augmented Robotic Fabrication) is developed, where motion sensor captures designer's hand-motion, filter algorithm recognizes the intention and update the preset program, robotic controller and RSI (Robotic Sensor Interface) adjusts robot's TCP (Tool Center Point) path in real time. With HARF workflow, two case studies of Hand-motion robotic dance and Free-form concrete wall are made.

This paper introduces an adaptive robotic spatial aggregation system for the development of an intricate self-supporting glass structure. Rather than using discrete and standardized building elements in the design and fabrication process, this research focuses on utilizing a non-arbitrary shape as an aggregated material for autonomous robotic assembly. More specifically, this paper presents an adaptive robotic fabrication pipeline that measures the size of hollow glass balls (inaccurate materials) as fabrication units to aggregate the entire glass structure. Ultraviolet (UV) curing adhesive is used as the bond between each glass element. Thus, through the live robotic programming as well as various combinations of spherical glass objects and UV curing adhesives/devices, the entire glass structure is self-supported. The project is aimed not only at the development of algorithms and a robotic fabrication system, but also the exploration of the aesthetics of glass materials. In other words, this project investigates a flexible and adaptable framework in response to live sensor data for the design and fabrication of nonstandard spatial structures aggregated out of discrete spherical glass elements, and it further explores glass material aesthetic and perception of architecture.

This research focuses on issues of coordination between designers and fabricators during early design. The aim of this work is to improve representations, enable more informed conversations, and streamline exchanges of digital models. In order to show the potential of the work, research is focused on architectural precast concrete facades. Previous work established methods for linking ``global'' and ``local'' parametric models of architectural intent and corresponding components, describing processes of mapping from individual custom panels to diagrammatic façade surfaces and vice-versa. Such mapping may be considered ``direct,'' wherein individual panel boundaries - defined by surface patterning - allow simple mapping of data from global to local or from local to global descriptions. However, there are some buildings with architectural precast concrete façades which do not permit direct relationships between global and local descriptions. These atypical facades require ``indirect'' maps containing additional layers of information in order to coordinate global and local descriptions. This paper describes two categories of these indirect scenarios: ``panelization'' and ``patterns across panels.''

In today's industrial production environment, an effective solution to the FLP (Facility Layout Problem) plays a significant role in deciding whether a facility will hold a competitive advantage against others by its improved workflow. This advantage comes from an efficient placement of facilities, which mostly contributes to the overall business performance. In addition to that, regarding the need to answer the demands of the dynamic market, facilities need to adapt their processes and adapt their production line as quickly as possible. Therefore, a continuous search for a solution to the FLP is present. Although there are many space allocation programs available both as academic and commercial products, present approaches' availability in the BIM environment is not common yet. This paper introduces a decision support system framework which uses Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to generate the most appropriate solution in Revit Dynamo environment both in the earlier phases of design and through the life-cycle of the facility. The proposed framework will specifically be responsible for generating solutions for equipment location in serial production facilities. As NSGA-II is a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA), a second optimization criterion is defined as the optimization of the foreman's locations distributed on the shop floor. A Dynamo package named Refinery will hold the optimization and evaluation procedures.

The paper presents a critical evaluation of the latest achievements in Building Information Modelling (BIM) implementation in academia, based on its adoption in Architecture curriculum at Lodz University of Technology, Poland. It reflects upon a significant shift in architectural practice which is strongly influencing ongoing modernization of higher education curricula. Furthermore, it undertakes the challenge to answer one of the main eCAADe2019 questions, viz.: ``What is the impact of new technologies in architectural education and practice, and, what are the emerging opportunities and main threats to our discipline?'' It contributes to the discussion on the place of BIM in academia - the controversial topic that still needs to be explored and debated to receive a comprehensive feedback and wider publicity.

Health is our wealth and we are rarely aware that the choice of living and working environment affects us. We spend most of our time in indoor environments so the quality of indoor air plays an important role in the maintenance of health and well-being. Moreover, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is emerging technology, which plays an essential role in collaboration among multi-discipline professions, time and cost saving, fabrication and construction as well as facilities management. However, it is not accepted by all planners yet. BIM could also offer a framework to help improving health and well-being of future users of the new building. The main aim of this paper is to monitor environmental and health impact data in BIM models to assure healthy living environments. First, the paper explores which environmental and health parameters could be measured in the indoor environment and which are already present in BIM models. Second, it explores options to expand BIM specifications to support monitoring environmental and health impact data in BIM models to assure healthy living environments.~

Using fuzzyTECH, a fuzzy logic software development tool, we devise all possible spatial relation inputs affecting physical and non-physical outputs for a given space using descriptive rule blocks. We implement this fuzzy logic system on an existing residential space to evaluate different layout alternatives. We define all linguistic input variables, output variables, and fuzzy sets, and present space-space relations using membership functions. We use the resulting database of fuzzy agents to evaluate the design of the existing residential spaces.

The permeation of various fields by the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) has arrived in the collective consciousness and is increasingly present in the physical world. Current results of AI research in the field of architecture illustrate that already today within every step of the architectural conception and fabrication approaches towards their automation are being made. Even the very human features of motivation and creativity aren't left untouched anymore. This paper discusses, on the basis of different concepts and examples, up to what extent the contemporary possible implementations of AI and their underlying algorithms are able to conquer the architectural profession. Furthermore, it presents a summary of an automation-concept for the whole profession.

Refurbishments and adaptations to existing building structures can be a challenging problem: Keeping track of all building measures (e.g. what walls, doors and installations to add or remove) is equally demanding as trying to keep an eye on the constraints (e.g. natural lighting) and functions that the changed structure will provide. It also demands a integrated view of the redesign (spatial aspect) and the refurbishment as a project (time aspect). To this end, we have been developing our planning tool ``Refurb!'', which lets a user plan refurbishments and adaptations to existing structures using a mixed metaphor of ``CAD-tool + project plan'', including a variety of analysis tools to compare the original state of a structure to the planned one (e.g. adjacency and circulation before and after adaptation). The tool is aimed at project planners and ranges from small scenarios (e.g. relocation/adaptation/refurbishment of a department) to big scenarios (e.g. relocation when bringing a hospital into service).

In this study, we developed a method for generating omnidirectional depth images from corresponding omnidirectional RGB images of streetscapes by learning each pair of omnidirectional RGB and depth images created by computer graphics using pix2pix. Then, the models trained with different series of images shot under different site and weather conditions were applied to Google street view images to generate depth images. The validity of the generated depth images was then evaluated visually. In addition, we conducted experiments to evaluate Google street view images using multiple participants. We constructed a model that estimates the evaluation value of these images with and without the depth images using the learning-to-rank method with deep convolutional neural network. The results demonstrate the extent to which the generalization performance of the streetscape evaluation model changes depending on the presence or absence of depth images.

Mass Customization systems in architecture have yet to adequately address the problem of capturing physical context, a fundamental aspect of dealing with building renovation, which has limited their scope of application. Previous research has demonstrated that existing methods of capturing as-built plans of rooms by non-expert users do not produce sufficiently accurate results for digital fabrication. The present paper reports on research into the development of an algorithm for semi-automated survey of convex or non-convex rooms by building owners. The improved workflow is tested by expert and non-expert users in a to-be renovated building and the results are compared with existing methods of survey.

We present an approach for computer-aided generation of different variations of floor plans during the early phases of conceptual design in architecture. The early design phases are mostly characterized by the processes of inspiration gaining and search for contextual help in order to improve the building design at hand. The generation method described in this work uses the novel as well as established artificial intelligence methods, namely, generative adversarial nets and case-based reasoning, for creation of possible evolutions of the current design based on the most similar previous designs. The main goal of this approach is to provide the designer with information on how the current floor plan can evolve over time in order to influence the direction of the design process. The work described in this paper is part of the methodology FLEA (Find, Learn, Explain, Adapt) whose task is to provide a holistic structure for support of the early conceptual phases in architecture. The approach is implemented as the adaptation component of the framework MetisCBR that is based on FLEA.

This paper illustrates the synergy of non-manifold topology (NMT) and a branch of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) called reinforcement learning (RL) in the context of evaluating fire egress in the early design stages. One of the important tasks in building design is to provide a reliable system for the evacuation of the users in emergency situations. Therefore, one of the motivations of this research is to provide a framework for architects and engineers to better design buildings at the conceptual design stage, regarding the necessary provisions in emergency situations. This paper presents two experiments using different state models within a simplified game-like environment for fire egress with each experiment investigating using one vs. three fire exits. The experiments provide a proof-of-concept of the effectiveness of integrating RL, graphs, and non-manifold topology within a visual data flow programming environment. The results indicate that artificial intelligence, machine learning, and RL show promise in simulating dynamic situations as in fire evacuations without the need for advanced and time-consuming simulations.

The complexity of the wall form affects the acoustics of the space. In this study, the effect of the complex form walls produced by nCloth dynamic simulation on the acoustics of an office space was investigated. In this research, reverberation time and Speech Transmission Index (STI) values of the pilot office space with one wall having complex form and the office space with all of the walls as flat were measured by acoustic simulation. As a result of the comparison, it has been found that, within speech intelligibility and reverberation time, the acoustics of the space with one wall having complex form is better than the acoustics of the space with all the walls as flat.

This paper explores through professional case studies how design solutions produced by expert teams compares to those developed through systematic parametric analysis. While the expert intuition of either single designer or teams helps to rapidly identify relevant aspects of the design problem and produce viable solutions, it has limitation to address multi-criteria design problems with conflicting objectives and searching for design alternatives. On the other hand, parametric analysis techniques in combination with data analysis methods helps to construct and analyze large design spaces of potential design solutions. For the purpose of this study, the specifications of geometric features and material properties of the building envelopes proposed by the expert design teams define the base line to measure the extent of the performance improvements of two typically conflicting objectives: Daylight quality and energy consumption. The results show consistently significant performance improvement after systematic optimization.

Numerous studies on Space Syntax and Evidence-based Design explored occupancy and movements in the built environment using traditional methods for behavior mapping, such as observation and surveys. This approach, however, has majorly focused on studying such behaviors as aggregated results -totals or averages- to corroborate the idea that people's interactions are outcomes of the influence of space. The research presented in this paper focuses on capturing human occupancy with a high spatiotemporal data resolution of 1 sq.ft per second (0.1 sq.mt./s). This research adapts computer vision to obtain large occupancy datasets in a hospitalization setting for one week, providing opportunities to explore correlations among spatial configurations, architectural programs, organizational activities planned and unplanned, and time. The vision is to develop new analytics for building occupancy dynamics, with the purpose of endorsing the integration of a temporal dimension into architectural research. This study introduces the ``Isovist-minute''; a metric that captures the relationship between space and occupancy, towards a point of interest, in a dynamic sequence.

This study explores to what extent Agent Based Systems (ABS) can handle multi-criteria optimization problems. The implementation of ABS in the field of optimization has limitations to address multiple criteria in a continuous generation process due to ABS usually merge the perceived information in a single response. To address this limitation, we increase the responsiveness of the systems through a multiple production approach. This approach breaks down the problem into two parts: the configuration through the interactions of the agents, and the overall performance through their local decisions. The method is tested in a case study of the network circulations of a park, optimizing the slope, views and sun. Performance and differentiation capabilities are evaluated in populations generated in two different scenarios. Data analysis methods verify the effectiveness of the algorithm and quantify the influence of each parameter on the final results.

The paper presents research for wind-responsive architecture. The main objective is the digital design methodology incorporating the dynamic, fluctuating wind flow into the shape-generating process of architectural envelopes. These computational studies are advanced and informed through physical prototyping models, allowing a hybrid method approach. The negative impacts of the wind at the building scale (wind loads), as well as urban scale (wind discomfort), can be avoided and even transformed into an advantage by incorporating the local wind conditions to the process of creating architectural envelopes with adaptive structures. The paper proposes a tensegrity-membrane system which, when exposed to the dynamic wind flow, enables a local passive shape adaptation. Thus, the action of the wind pressure transforms the shape of the building envelope to an unsmoothed, dimpled surface. As a consequence, the aerodynamic properties of the building are modified, which contributes to reducing wind suction and drag force. Moreover, the slight shape change materializes and articulates the immaterial wind phenomena. For a better understanding of the dynamic geometric properties, one unit of the wind-responsive envelope is tested through simulations, and through physical prototypes. The idea and material-geometric studies are subsequently applied in a specific case study, including a designed building envelope in an industrial silo cluster in Stockholm.

In the quest to achieve the ambitious climate and clean energy targets the broad implementation of Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) is one of the keys. Photovoltaic (PV) modules can be installed above or on current roofing or traditional wall structures. In addition, BIPV devices substitute the skin of the exterior construction frame, i.e. the weather screen, thus simultaneously acting as both a climate screen and an energy producing source. However, while the integral planning strategy to building projects promotes the effective execution of BIPV, the limitation lies in the absence of both instruments and easy-to-use planning aid guidelines, particularly by non-PV experts in the early design stage. This study presents computational methods that help to quickly analyze the BIPV potential for a given building project and to suggest the optimal economical amount and location of the panels based on the building's energy demand profile.

The notion of design spaces (DS) can be understood as the potential of a parametric model, it is basically the number of possible combinations for its input parameters. When combining tools that produce these alternatives automatically with different simulation softwares, the concept of parametric analysis (PA) emerges. This implies a simultaneous evaluation of the alternatives as they are constructed by the parametric model, producing large amounts of information. This article describes a sectional approach to the management of this information and a visualization technique to represent it looking for correlations between the input parameters and their performance. Correlations that are fundamental to making decisions with confidence when design problems challenge traditional methods of decision-making based on heuristics and design expertise.

onsolidated urban areas usually present a challenge for the sustainable design decisions for the architect. The site, orientation and surrounding built environment compromise both passive and active systems, shortening the possible optimization measures available, leaving the designer with doubts as far as efficiency is concerned.BIM methodologies and visual programming languages have opened up a very wide range of design and analysis tools allowing the architect to make informed decisions based on data extracted from the models. Nonetheless it's optimization is through a slow process of trial and error, creating a significant limitation. This paper discusses the potentialities of the use of evolutionary algorithms to generate optimized solutions for facade solar orientation. A comparison between three different evolutionary algorithms aiming for solar radiation, inside average temperature allows to conclude the best result versus time consumed. Although under similar results the multi-objective EA represents the best compromise between time and final objective on the case study chosen for the paper. The interconnectivity in real time of BIM and algorithmic modeling softwares represents an advantage for time saving sustainable design decisions.

The technological breakthrough on photovoltaic facades and the high potential for installing photovoltaic (PV) systems in the city of Salvador are the motivation for this article. This case study explores the feasibility of implementing solar energy technology on a building facade, proposing a design method for optimizing insolation performance by the form-finding process in a parameterized shape. The goal was to generate a parametric design workflow, in which it could be found some facade shapes, generating triangle and quadrilateral supporting grids, leading to better results in the total amount of radiation in comparison to the basic flat facade. In these supporting grids were evaluated also the fitting in the distribution of quadrilateral commercial PV cells, measuring its geometric compatibility. By the results, it could be verified the gains and losses in PV potential in several instances obtained by the form-finding process, as the potentials to consider this in the design of every building.

Situated within the art of cutting solids (stereotomy) and the evolution of machine tools; this research will investigate subtractive fabrication in relation to robotic carving of stone structures. The advancement of the industrial revolutions in the mid to late 19th century saw the rise of new building techniques and materials which were primarily based on structural steel construction. The modern aesthetic of the time further diminished the place of traditional stonework and ornamentation in modern structures within the building arts. This paper will focus on the design and fabrication of three sculptural dry-stone modular prototypes investigating interlocking self-supporting structures in stone. Examining the value of robotic technologies in the design and construction process in relation to collaborative crafting of the hand and machine. Accommodating for material tolerances which are a major factor in this research. Interrogating the value of robotic crafting with material implications and exploring the role of the artisan in machine crafted architectural components.

This paper discusses the potential of emerging digital fabrication techniques to produce material-efficient thin folded concrete structures. Although in the 50s and 60s folded structures provided a common optimal solution for spanning large distances without additional vertical supports, today, the number of these projects decreased significantly due to their complicated formworks and labour-intensive realization. Digital fabrication methods for concrete hold the promise to efficiently produce intricate folded mass-customized shapes with enhanced load-bearing capacity. This paper focuses on a robotic slip-forming process, Smart Dynamic Casting (SDC), to produce various thin-walled folded concrete elements with the same formwork providing smooth surface finish and gradual variations along the height. An empirical research methodology was applied to evaluate the fabrication feasibility of digitally designed thin folded geometries with one-to-one scale prototypes. Despite the discovered design limitations due to fabrication and material constraints, the exploration led to a new promising research direction, termed `Digital Casting'.

Collaborative Robots, or Cobots, bring new possibilities for human-machine interaction within the fabrication process, allowing each actor to contribute with their specific capabilities. However creative interaction brings unexpected changes, obstacles, complexities and non-linearities which are encountered in real time and cannot be predicted in advance. This paper presents an experimental methodology for robotic path planning using Machine Learning. The focus of this methodology is obstacle avoidance. A neural network is deployed, providing a relationship between the robot's pose and its surroundings, thus allowing for motion planning and obstacle avoidance, directly integrated within the design environment. The method is demonstrated through a series of case-studies. The method combines haptic teaching with machine learning to create a task specific dataset, giving the robot the ability to adapt to obstacles without being explicitly programmed at every instruction. This opens the door to shifting to robotic applications for construction in unstructured environments, where adapting to the singularities of the workspace, its occupants and activities presents an important computational hurdle today.

This paper lays out a fabrication and simulation method for an adaptable and reusable moulding system for the production of fibre reinforced concrete elements. This research leverages soft robots and their computational controllability as means of a composite material and as such the base of a controlled and adaptable moulding system. This paper describes the development of this programmable material towards a functioning system for casting processes with fibre glass reinforced concrete. The controllable material allows to deploy target shapes and to eliminate supplementary falsework and the customized production of moulds for doubly-curved concrete elements. It also lays out a feedback method, which serves as adjustment tool of the simulation to the physical behaviour of the material as well as simulation method for target based geometries.

This paper presents a project-based research study using the beta version of Oriole-a custom-made animation-based plug-in for grasshopper 3D visual programming environment, to develop robotic motion/controlling solutions. Oriole, as a parametric tool, makes it possible for designers/users to ``design''-instead of generating, the motions of the robot based on the notion of keyframing and time-based animation. Through the use of Oriole, users can simulate-and ultimately develop robotic motions/performances in more intuitive ways. This unique feature enables users with minor or no programming background to create robotic solutions using Oriole as a software/plugin Bridge.Using Rhinoceros 3D as a digital modeling platform in conjunction with Grasshopper 3D and its robotic simulation platforms, Oriole can develop controlling strategies for different industrial robots such as KUKA, ABB, and Universal Robots. Oriole enables designers to create a precise interaction between the robot, its spatial ``performance'' and the physical environment, through animation and keyframing to ``design'' robotic interactions and movements as frames of animation instead of segments of a curve ``path.''

Project InFoamed Matter works with foam and explores the internal logic of the material and develops a construction system based on fluidity and expansion. The basic unit of the system consists of two elements, that continuously exchange their roles in the construction process - the frame (controlling element made of paper or, in later development, from glass or carbon fiber cured in epoxy resin) and the expander (filling element consisting of 2k polyurethane foam). The expander fills up voids within the frame. While initially only the frame plays crucial structural role within a system, the expander being a filling element, eventually the hardening process switches the roles, hardened expander being the structural core and the frame being a form-defining tool. In later development, fiber frame creates a composite together with hardened expander, being able to resist both tension and compression forces. Project further proposes computational model, which generates positions and orientations for placing further components as well as a robotic fiber laying, assembly and injection system, which leads to novel automated construction system based on material behavior.

Fabricating process with robotic awareness and creativity makes architect able to explore the new boundary between digital and material world. Although parametric and generative design method make diverse processing of materials possible for robots, it's still necessary to establish a new design-fabrication framework, where we could simultaneously deal with designers, robots, data, sensor technology and material natural characters. In order to develop a softer system without gap between preset program and robot's varying environments, this paper attempts to establish an environment-computer-robot workflow and transform traditional robotic fabrication from linear to more tangible and suitable for architects` and designers' intuitive motion and gesture. RAF (Robotic Aware Fabrication), a concept of real-time external enhancement fabrication is proposed, and a new workflow of HARF (Hand-motion Augmented Robotic Fabrication) is developed, where motion sensor captures designer's hand-motion, filter algorithm recognizes the intention and update the preset program, robotic controller and RSI (Robotic Sensor Interface) adjusts robot's TCP (Tool Center Point) path in real time. With HARF workflow, two case studies of Hand-motion robotic dance and Free-form concrete wall are made.

This paper introduces an adaptive robotic spatial aggregation system for the development of an intricate self-supporting glass structure. Rather than using discrete and standardized building elements in the design and fabrication process, this research focuses on utilizing a non-arbitrary shape as an aggregated material for autonomous robotic assembly. More specifically, this paper presents an adaptive robotic fabrication pipeline that measures the size of hollow glass balls (inaccurate materials) as fabrication units to aggregate the entire glass structure. Ultraviolet (UV) curing adhesive is used as the bond between each glass element. Thus, through the live robotic programming as well as various combinations of spherical glass objects and UV curing adhesives/devices, the entire glass structure is self-supported. The project is aimed not only at the development of algorithms and a robotic fabrication system, but also the exploration of the aesthetics of glass materials. In other words, this project investigates a flexible and adaptable framework in response to live sensor data for the design and fabrication of nonstandard spatial structures aggregated out of discrete spherical glass elements, and it further explores glass material aesthetic and perception of architecture.

This research focuses on issues of coordination between designers and fabricators during early design. The aim of this work is to improve representations, enable more informed conversations, and streamline exchanges of digital models. In order to show the potential of the work, research is focused on architectural precast concrete facades. Previous work established methods for linking ``global'' and ``local'' parametric models of architectural intent and corresponding components, describing processes of mapping from individual custom panels to diagrammatic faÃ§ade surfaces and vice-versa. Such mapping may be considered ``direct,'' wherein individual panel boundaries - defined by surface patterning - allow simple mapping of data from global to local or from local to global descriptions. However, there are some buildings with architectural precast concrete faÃ§ades which do not permit direct relationships between global and local descriptions. These atypical facades require ``indirect'' maps containing additional layers of information in order to coordinate global and local descriptions. This paper describes two categories of these indirect scenarios: ``panelization'' and ``patterns across panels.''

In today's industrial production environment, an effective solution to the FLP (Facility Layout Problem) plays a significant role in deciding whether a facility will hold a competitive advantage against others by its improved workflow. This advantage comes from an efficient placement of facilities, which mostly contributes to the overall business performance. In addition to that, regarding the need to answer the demands of the dynamic market, facilities need to adapt their processes and adapt their production line as quickly as possible. Therefore, a continuous search for a solution to the FLP is present. Although there are many space allocation programs available both as academic and commercial products, present approaches' availability in the BIM environment is not common yet. This paper introduces a decision support system framework which uses Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to generate the most appropriate solution in Revit Dynamo environment both in the earlier phases of design and through the life-cycle of the facility. The proposed framework will specifically be responsible for generating solutions for equipment location in serial production facilities. As NSGA-II is a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA), a second optimization criterion is defined as the optimization of the foreman's locations distributed on the shop floor. A Dynamo package named Refinery will hold the optimization and evaluation procedures.

The paper presents a critical evaluation of the latest achievements in Building Information Modelling (BIM) implementation in academia, based on its adoption in Architecture curriculum at Lodz University of Technology, Poland. It reflects upon a significant shift in architectural practice which is strongly influencing ongoing modernization of higher education curricula. Furthermore, it undertakes the challenge to answer one of the main eCAADe2019 questions, viz.: ``What is the impact of new technologies in architectural education and practice, and, what are the emerging opportunities and main threats to our discipline?'' It contributes to the discussion on the place of BIM in academia - the controversial topic that still needs to be explored and debated to receive a comprehensive feedback and wider publicity.

Health is our wealth and we are rarely aware that the choice of living and working environment affects us. We spend most of our time in indoor environments so the quality of indoor air plays an important role in the maintenance of health and well-being. Moreover, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is emerging technology, which plays an essential role in collaboration among multi-discipline professions, time and cost saving, fabrication and construction as well as facilities management. However, it is not accepted by all planners yet. BIM could also offer a framework to help improving health and well-being of future users of the new building. The main aim of this paper is to monitor environmental and health impact data in BIM models to assure healthy living environments. First, the paper explores which environmental and health parameters could be measured in the indoor environment and which are already present in BIM models. Second, it explores options to expand BIM specifications to support monitoring environmental and health impact data in BIM models to assure healthy living environments.

This article presents the scenario of programming use by architects and engineers, creating their own unique tools. The goal is to emulate and understand the phenomenon of BIM software customization by developing plug-ins that can explore the human-environment relationship. Demonstrates the process for building a plugin that seeks to equalize the theory of accessibility technical standards, visually impaired and architects. Uses Design Science Research methodologies to guide the construction of artifacts for specific practical problems and the Collaborative Design / Codesign to understand and know the users' expertise. It is argued that the low quality of projects that include elements for the orientation of the visually impaired in Brazil is often related to an unstructured methodology in which important aspects such as the real needs of this group and the human-environment relationship are neglected.

On May 2018 the Brazilian federal government published the Decree 9.377 setting a National Strategy for Information and Dissemination of Building Information Modelling - BIM to enable its adoption by public administration. This strategy has nine targets and among them the task of training professionals in BIM to support the demand that should be generated. A period between 2018 and 2021 has been planned to establish learning objectives and develop model disciplines, a process that, however, should not start from scratch because there are already some BIM training initiatives being performed in the country since the early 2000s. This paper has done an overview on this production highlighting some relevant conceptual contributions to this debate aiming to address challenges and possible ways to support the expected Architectural and Engineering courses restructuring.

The article presents the application of the Visual Protection Surface (VPS) method in protecting waterfront panoramas. The digital analysis of visual impact, which is most frequently used in urban planning, assesses the impact of new investment on the cityscape. The study presented in the article is based on a reverse approach -determining the maximum height of buildings so new facilities do not distort protected vistas in a city, vistas which are crucial for the preservation of the city's cultural identity and spatial identification. The assessment of the application is based on a case study of GdaÅ„sk, Poland, where a 3D LiDAR model was used. The study involved the use of software developed by the author (C++). It also analyzed VPS input parameters. Conclusions can be used to assess and verify analysis findings with different software (GIS/CAD). The article shows the potential application of the VPS method in urban planning.

In Brazil, the evaluation processes of building architectural designs of Airports Passenger Terminal (PT) are carried out manually. It depends on the architects' knowledge, leading to possible errors. On the other hand, the rule checking in BIM-modeled building projects opens up new horizons for this type of activity. Based on Code Checking concepts, this paper presents a method for automating rule checking for building code in building architectural design of PT. Following the aspects of Design Science Research, it is developed in two stages: Construction (theoretical foundation, creating rule checking for the PT, implementation of the rules in BIM softwares for code checking and validation) and Evaluation of artefact. This paper shows a series of problems resulting from the evaluation of PT using traditional methods. It can be concluded that the use of rules for regulatory code checking with BIM allows standardization in the evaluation of architectural design of PT.

Evolutionary computation is a population-based problem solver that is characterized by a stochastic optimization in order to solve both a single objective and multiple objectives. Previous evolutionary computational researches provided various design options and improved optimization through being evolved with fitness criteria, especially when multiple design objectives conflict with one another. In this paper, a rule-based algorithm was combined with the evolutionary computational process to propose an assembly logic of the modules and to improve an architectural building design in order to adapt to environmental changes. Two algorithms - a rule based and generative algorithmproceeded simultaneously and provided various options as well as optimization in real time. For the experiment set-up, existing buildings were divided into each module; the modules were reinterpreted and reassembled with the logic driven by Evolutionary Developmental Biology. The conclusion is that when a rule based logic is combined with a developmental algorithm with a modular system, it is more efficient for the design process to be analyzed, evaluated, and optimized. The ultimate outcome provides various options in a short amount of time.

We present a tool intended to enable non-expert users to apply and manipulate a shape grammar, SMUG, which encodes the urban design of informal settlements such as favelas. Such tool, the Interpreter, was developed considering that students would be its main users, and therefore we consider this grammar implementation to potentially be a multipurpose pedagogical tool since it supports conveying knowledge about urban design, shape grammars and parametric modeling using Grasshopper. This paper focuses on the development of the Interpreter and discusses the results of its use in a design studio, which can better inform subsequent iteration as well as other courses and schools.

The study aimed to verify whether the proposed method allows non-expert users to configure a house design that meets their expectations in a limited time. The experiments were carried out in two modes of the tool: M mode - modification of a proposed design and S mode - configuration of a design from scratch. The study encompassed two independent experiments carried out on two continents and examined the impact of cultural differences on the expectations of non-expert users towards computer-assisted customization of single-family houses.

This article will describe the recent steps in the development of a computational generative system based on the selection and combination of ordinary architectural elements. Built as a Grasshopper definition, the system was conceived to generate designs of architectural faÃ§ades and to produce models, physical and digital, for didactic use. More specifically, The paper will address the conception of controlling devices, that is, the parts of the computational system that govern design variations. This process involved two complementary actions: first, the definition of a clear organizational logic, where elements can be represented as a data structure that encompasses classes, sub-classes, sets, libraries and attributes; secondly, the establishment of means to operate the variations through the use of filters and heuristics based on visual patterns, allowing varying degrees of automation and user control. It will be argued that such organizational model paves the way to increase the number of design possibilities in the future and to and provide means to integrate of architectural criteria into the generation process. This research has received the support of CNPq.

In this project we used the concept of shape grammars as a tool for understanding the vernacular heritage in the Moorish village of Aljezur in the South of Portugal, and subsequently use it to guide the planning rehabilitation and growth of the village. First, we inferred a grammar for describing the existent vernacular heritage, and based on it developed two other grammars suitable for the rehabilitation of pre-existences and the construction of new houses involving features that can harmoniously mingle with the heritage surroundings. This paper supports the use of shape grammars for the development of heritage safeguard strategies in historical urban agglomerates.

Most cities is becoming densely populated in unstable society. Demand for single-person households is increasing and also the demand for collective housing is increasing. In this situation, urban housing should be open and flexible and should move toward increasing opportunities for social exchange and satisfaction of resident. In this paper, development of new collective housing was explored to enable flexible and efficient communication and sharing by utilizing branch structure through Constructal theory on efficient flow in system. The methodology was proposed for future collective housing design through parametric design model with tree diagram that show the flow of shared spaces. This could be a solution to future social sustainability as a proposal to increase the shareability and respond to the demand for new building shapes.

In normative or prescriptive theories, architectural requirements are set as parameters to support design decisions. A set of formal parameters is suffice to generate a wide variety of compositions, but associated to the same formal language. This paper looks at the work of the Portuguese-Brazilian architect, Delfim Fernandes Amorim, whose contributions to the dissemination of modern ideas and the development of a particular architectural lexicon is quite relevant, particularly his addendum to the municipal land use and occupation act, which became generally known as the Amorim's Law. It consists basically in allowing spaces of transitory occupation and specific architectural elements to be built beyond the mandatory setback limits. This paper presents the development of a grammar that shows how some of the parameters described in Amorim's law are able to create a strong formal language and influence the building's architectural composition. The grammar was developed in two successive stages: the first allows the generation of the pattern of adjacency of the apartment's rooms; the second, guide the insertion of the openings and architectural elements as defined by the Amorim's Law.

Predicates and directives are proposed to extend the versatility and expressivity of a shape rule specification `language'. Specifically, a predicate serves to express a condition on the application of a parametric-associative shape rule that cannot simply be explicated within the left-hand side shape. A directive, on the other hand, is a value specification that is required when applying a parametric-associative shape rule, where this value specification cannot be derived from or expressed within the right-hand-side shape. We discuss the benefits of a set of predicates and directives to address seemingly simple requests that might actually be hard to express otherwise. Specifically, we elaborate on the motivation for introducing predicates and directives, and demonstrate the various predicates and directives in more detail, including their implementation.

We present an Environmental Analysis and Safety Advisor system capable of identify the environmental barriers and hazards found in the homes of elderly people. This augmented reality tool runs on a portable computing device and can be used by informal and formal caregivers without specific knowledge of Accessible Design, to evaluate the safeness of an elderly home environment, ensuring that potential fall hazards are detected and corrected. The system recognizes specific indoor elements of the house (e.g. arm-chair, bed, chair), and then computes and analyses their mutual distances in the environment so that a warning of hazard is emitted in case of need (e.g. loose cable, not enough space to pass a wheelchair). In this context, we implemented object recognition at the category level of miniature versions of real sized furniture and the determination of the distance between neighboring objects, signaling if it is below a certain threshold value. Environmental Analysis tool can then recognize furniture and measure the distance between two furniture elements enabling the system to pop up an alert sign if the space left does not guarantee good accessibility.

Augmented Reality (AR) technologies are often perceived as the most impactful method to enhance the communication between the designer and the client during the iterative design process. However, the significance of designing the User Interface (UI) and the User Experience (UX) are often underestimated. To intercede, this research aims to employ new and existing techniques to develop UI's, and comparatively assess ``the accuracy and completeness with which specified users can achieve specified goals in particular environments'' (Stone, 2005) - a notion this research delineates as `effectiveness'. Prompted by the work of key scholars, the developed UI's were assessed through the lens of existing UI evaluation techniques, including: Usability Heuristics (Nielsen, 1994) and Visual and Cognitive Heuristics (Zuk and Carpendale, 2006). In partnership with PTW Architects, characteristics such as the rapidity and complexity of interactions, in conjunction with the interface's simplicity and intuitiveness, were extracted from 15 trials underwent by architectural practitioners. The outcomes of this research highlights strategies for the effective development of user interface design for mobile augmented reality applications.

Virtual reality (VR) has been suggested for various purposes in the field of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC). This research explores new roles for VR toward the super-smart society in the near future. In particular, we propose to develop post-processing rendering, segmentation-rendering and shadow-casting rendering algorithms for novel VR expressions to enable more versatile approaches than the normal photorealistic red, green, and blue (RGB) expressions. We succeeded in applying a wide variety of VR renderings in urban-design projects after implementation. The developed system can create images in real time to train deep-learning algorithms, can also be applied to landscape analysis and contribute to advanced user experience.

The intersection of music and architecture (spatial design) has remained a fascination for practitioners and researchers for many years. This paper reports on the development of a Virtual Drumming Environment (VDE) that provides a research and cross-domain performance environment for musico-spatial design research explorations.The VDE is explored as a means of revealing affordances related to the complexities of polyrhythmic drumming through cross-domain representation of MIDI data as polyrhythmic event-time-dynamics molecules (PM) within virtual space. Further to this, we explore the VDE as a cross-domain performance environment where new modes of musico-spatial improvisation are revealed that extend drumming's `known worlds' (Bruford, 2015).

Virtual Reality technology was used as a visualization tool in a participatory design process of an urban design project in Santiago, Chile. Community members with little or no familiarity with digital technologies visualized the project using traditional means of architectural representation and immersive virtual reality, and then, answered standardized questionnaires on spatial comprehension. Participants who visualized the project using virtual reality showed a higher level of spatial comprehension and a more precise understanding of the formal and spatial qualities of the project than users who used traditional means.

As many other areas of human activity, the architectural design process has been recently shaken by Virtual Reality (VR), as it offers new ways to experience and communicate architectural space. In this paper we propose Live Coding in Virtual Reality (LCVR), a design approach that allows architects to benefit from the advantages of VR within an algorithmic design workflow. LCVR integrates a live coding solution, where the architect programs his design intent and immediately receives feedback on the changes applied to the program; and VR, which means this workflow takes place inside the virtual environment, where the architect is immersed in the model that results from the program he is concurrently updating from inside VR. In this paper we discuss the possible impacts of such an approach, as well as the most pressing implementation issues. We offer a critical analysis and comparison of the various solutions available in the context of two different programming paradigms: visual and textual.

The paper will give an overview of our experiments in the past years in developing different interfaces and workflows for the use of low cost Head Mounted Displays (HMD) for Virtual Reality solution. We are mainly interested in using VR tools for designers in the early phases of their design. In our opinion VR tools can help to bring back a better understanding of space and scale which have been lost a little bit in the last century with the change from analogue to digital tools. After teaching architectural and urban design for many years we can clearly say that this effect is still ongoing and it is time that we develop digital tools that try to reverses thi effect. We will then concentrate within this paper on discussing some aspects of data reduction that are important to be able to use these tools in the design process. We are also showing how we use our interfaces presenting some results of student projects for a design in Hong Kong and the strategies and methods for using VR for a ongoing work on a project about the establishment of a so called ``bicycle highway'' in the city of Graz in Austria.

This paper discusses Augmented Reality (AR) as means to interact with information regarding infrastructure projects before, under and after construction. For that purpose, two different prototypes were developed using Apples ARKit and Unity's game design platform and tested on two use cases. However, the main focus of this paper is interacting with infrastructure information through AR rather than researching core AR technology. We learned that using AR under the constructing phase with subsurface utilities is still facing several difficulties. Especially when it comes to accessing and interacting with information in a changing construction environment. These difficulties will be discussed and also the challenges regarding information flow between civil engineering and AR software.

This paper presents the prototyping of new methods by which functionally graded materials can be specified and produced. The paper presents a case study exploring how machine learning can be used to train a model in order to predict fabrication files from formalised design requirements. By using knit as a model for material fabrication, the paper outlines the making of new cyclical design methods employing machine learning in which simpler prototypical materials acts as input for more complex graded materials. A case study - Ombre - showcases the implementation of this workflow and results and perspectives are discussed.

This paper documents the design and fabrication process of modular responsive lighting installation. The design and research led to a modular and transformable urban lighting concept, combining unique material behaviour and cyber-physical system. The main goal was to investigate how material characteristics, composition and performance could be programmed in order to generate a range of modular components. Modular tiles and joints combination designed of sustainable materials - bioplastics and cork sheets - were created and used together with number of sensors and micro-controllers. Furthermore, the installation concept links technical and psychological aspects that potentially could be used for the benefits of city dwellers. Paper consists of two parts. First part is the introduction of a broader urban night lighting design context to which the project belongs. This includes covering existing social issues related to urban darkness, as well as the need to increase biodiversity within built environment, through introducing new materials. The second part of the paper describes the design and fabrication process, that employs the conclusions discovered in the first part through set of material experimentations, design project and the reflections on the results.

Mycelium-based bio-composites can propose a renewable and biodegradable alternative for architectural construction materials. These biomaterials result from growth of mycelium, fibrous root systems of fungi, on organic substrates in controlled environmental conditions. This paper presents a material study that explores how substrate type and added supplements used for cultivating mycelium affect the compressive strength of mycelium-based composites for use as masonry units in architectural construction. For this purpose, samples grown using Pleurotus Ostreatus (Gray Oyster mushroom strain) on three different substrates (sawdust, straw and a mixture of sawdust and straw) with and without supplementation are tested for compressive strength.

Soil is still used as a building material in many parts of the world, especially in rural areas. Approximately 30% of the world's population is still living in shelters made by soil (Berge 2009). One of the techniques is using soil in mudbrick form, which is sun dried instead of being fired in kilns. However, mud bricks have low compressive and tensile strength. Instead of enhancing the mix formula, we focus on designing the geometry of the brick itself to improve walls' overall compressive and tensile strength. The goal of the research is to explore an innovative way to build masonry walls through geometrical examination together with computer aided design. Unlike traditional horizontal laying of the rectangular brick elements, 3D designed blocks take advantage of gravity and foster an accelerated assembly without mortar. They create a balance point in the middle of the wall during the construction. The geometry of V-INCA blocks allows dry construction which will reduce the amount of time spent on the site. Load distribution and the friction between two surfaces are sufficient to have a dry construction. Thus, a wall built with V-INCA is stronger intrinsically due to its geometry.

This paper introduces Actuated Textile Hybrids, and describes the steps needed to steer the form finding processes necessary for their production. The method presented employs an integration of an ``activated'' instead of a pre-stressed textile membrane to design different stages of force equilibrium within the Hybrid Structure, and to investigate the potentials of ever flexible shaping of tensile elements. The set-up for the Textile Hybrid consists of three main elements which are digitally and physically analysed in their inextricable interdependence in force, form and material. Together, the bending active beam (rod), the textile membrane and an applied pattern which actively shrinks surface areas of the membrane (activation), create the base for the form finding process.With advanced Finite Element Modelling software and the architects resulting ability to engineer responsive building-systems for a dynamic environment, it is essential to rethink the construction methods and the building-material of the classic building envelope. This is to not only develop a smartly engineered sustainable skin but also a boundary object which, due to its adaptation, develops the potential to interconnect with its surrounding to re-establish the relationships between nature, home and inhabitant.

This thesis research deals with the architectural project from an interdisciplinary point of view, integrating biomimetics, additive fabrication, computer vision, and robotics. The work focuses on the feedback interaction loop among robotic additive fabrication, a stigmergic agent-based system and the self-organizing properties of the material. The aim is to explore the morphological, constructive and expressive potentials generated by the mutual influence of computational design, construction behavioral rules, and physical material behavior (whose complexity exceeds current simulation capacity).The proposed approach leads to the creation of surface-based tectonics, enhanced with a fiberglass-coated dendritic ridge formation that integrates functional, ornamental and structural performances. The process can be extended to larger architectural scales with the creation of bespoke EPS molds via robotic hot wire cutting; the presented case study leverages the aforementioned process on ruled surfaces for the generation of translucent delimiters, used to create heterogeneous spatial organization.

A column is an archetypal constituent of architecture which historically underwent constant reiteration in accordance with the prevalent architectural style, material culture or technical and structural possibilities. The project reimagined this architectural element through harnessing the synergies of digital design, textile logic, and contemporary biotechnology. Textile materiality and aesthetic are deeply rooted in architectural history as a soft and ephemeral antipode to rigid building materials. An investigation in historic mechanical hand-knitting techniques allowed to extract their underlying structural and geometric logic to develop a structural optimisation pipeline with a graded yarn as a base material and a geometric optimization based on local distribution of knitting patterns. Bacterially driven biocalcification was applied to transform the soft textile structure into a rigid material. Hereby an active textile microbiome was established through colonizing of the yarn with the bacterium S. pasteurii which successively precipitated calcite on microscale within the textile substrate hence ultimately influencing the global structural behaviour of the column.

This paper focuses on a new form making method of spontaneous materiality under limited digital control, as a supplement to the trending method of digital materiality. A specific emphasis is placed on the connection between material selection and sensational expression in the contemporary information and digital technologies era. Spontaneous materiality refers to the alteration of material attributes by natural forces. The current techniques of digital materiality rely on accurate digital control and inhibit from the intervention of any unpredictable material variable, which shows excessive scientific calculations and a loss of artistic articulation in design. In the new form making method proposed here, intentional yet limited digital control sets the material framework where the combination of soft and hard materials takes place. With the influence of gravity and spatiotemporal accumulation of selected materials, the fusion of softness and hardness brings a coexistence of different material states and qualities in one object. Thus an integration of shape and matter produces a blurring boundary between physical material and digital form, and more importantly, a sensational experience with expectational slippages of vision and touch. Additional to the ongoing discussion of computation, this design research expands the potential of computation by restricting its influence.

In terms of the efficiency and informatization in the architecture and construction industry, the Fourth Industrial Revolution presents positive aspects of technological development, but we need to discuss the expanded concept, the Anthropocene. The era of the human-made environment having a powerful influence on the global system is called Anthropocene. Since the 1950s, many indicators representing human activity and earth system have shown the `Great acceleration'. Currently, lots of urban data including building information, construction waste, and GHG emission ratio is indicating how much the urban area was contaminated with artifacts. So, the integrated planning and design approach are needed for sustainable design with data integration. This paper examines the GIS, LCA and BIM tools focusing on building information and environmental load. With the literature review, the computational system for sustainable design is demonstrated to integrate into one holistic framework for the Anthropocene. There were some limitations that data was simplified during the statistical processing, and the framework has limitations that must be demonstrated by actual data in the future. However, this could be an early approach to integrating geospatial and environmental analysis with the design framework. And it can be applied to another urban area for sustainable urban models for the Anthropocene

We imagine the buildings of a not too distant future (constructions that we will inhabit) as the combination of digital design, additive manufacturing, advanced robotics, sensors, transmitters, information in the cloud, information of networks, information of other robot networks, etc. all interconnected and with autonomous response. We imagine the skin as a biomimetic envelope of autonomous response to environmental changes. We perceive that skin, or the envelope of the architectural construction made with personalized products, a physical object created by printing layer by layer of a three-dimensional model or 3D digital drawing, an additive manufacturing or 3D printing. We do not rule out that this physical object can be printed in 4D in a process in which the skin itself or envelope built by a process linked to advanced robotics and AI can generate products that modify themselves to respond to changes climatic.

The paper describes an urban storm water management model under development designed specifically for architects, allowing the visualization of storm water management scenarios in urban blocks, as well as the quantitative comparison of their impact to the microclimate. It seeks to answer the question of how computational technologies can help architects integrate storm water management into the design process and engage with water sensitive design principles through the development of an ``architect-friendly'' model. The model is expected to function as a simulation tool that will support design decisions on storm water management retrofitting measures in urban blocks, by allowing the evaluation of an urban water improvement project at its initial design stage, as well as the generation and comparison of alternate water integration design solutions. Selected urban blocks in Greece will be used as case studies to test and evaluate the urban water model during the model development stage.

The paper discusses the design and testing of sustainable recycled materials for large scale 3D printed construction in a marine context. This research is part of a 3-phase project involving a multidisciplinary team of designers, architects, material specialists and marine ecologists. The Bio Shelters Project uses an innovative approach to designing and fabricating marine bio-shelters that ecologically enhance seawalls, by promoting native biodiversity and providing seawater filtration, carbon sequestration and fisheries productivity. The design of the 3D print structure is a data-driven approach that incorporates ecological data to optimise the form for growth and survivorship of marine species under the environmental conditions of the installation site as well as being an integral part of the design project and the site.

This paper explores the user - experience transformations that occur after the deployment of ICT in the redevelopment projects of three archeological - monumental spaces, in Rome, Italy. The study consists in a detailed analysis of their contextual and typological configuration aiming to explain the following: how different is the user experience in these three different Smart tourism projects, how this experience is spatially transformed and how does preserving the cultural heritage through the use of ICT transforms the user experience? The analysis showed that ICT supports new ways of thinking about user experience, while it alters the shaping of this experience per se at macro and micro scales and in terms of the emotional state and user learning path.

During the last two decades, the introduction of digital multimedia into the museums, monuments and exhibition spaces describe a new open and flexible institution, which is attentive to the needs of its visitors. In fact, many different opinions, preferences and personalized agendas acquire now a symbiotic relationship with the strict archeological site contexts with ICT. This relationship is established the moment that the actual space comes into terms with the visitors' needs and without compromising spatially, it reveals all the different movement alternatives that could satisfy the visitor. In fact, ICTs create alternative experiences through the juxtaposition of a digital layer on physical space. Drawing on this objective, this paper studies the relation between user and monument by enhancing their interaction in the Municipal Market of Chania, in Crete. The objective of the paper is to examine how state-of-the-art IoT systems can be seamlessly incorporated into the smart cultural heritage strategy of the suggested place. The macroscope is to explore alternatives strategies to enhance sustainable tourism in Chania.

French colonial authorities realized numerous Modernist housing projects in the city of Algiers in the 1950s. Residents, mostly of low-income local communities, have modified these buildings over time to fulfill updated needs in overpopulation. While the government relocated the residents of some complexes to new settlements and demolished the buildings, in some, residences continued to live in and adapt the physical properties of the dwellings for new generations. These residents are already active agents in housing rehabilitation. Their modifications are almost systemic and have a language, inspiring sustainable approaches that are alternative to complete abolishment of architectural heritage. The efforts of the residents can be organized and enhanced with digital fabrication and open source sharing platforms of the maker culture. In pursuit of a rehabilitation strategy to these sites, we formally analyze the dweller modifications and assess the residents' competencies in order to formulate a context-oriented resident-driven do-it-yourself support framework.

Digital technologies have recently been at the forefront of the causal link between making and design. A growing number of architecture programs of universities incorporates fabrication to the educational environment, and even to the curriculum. Fabrication technology is now considered among the set of tools students are expected to acquire a basic knowledge of and skills in. Nevertheless, the pedagogical potential of fabrication in communicating traditions of making is underused in an oversight of the continuity of the relevant know-how. Our position is that traditions of making can be the subject matter of fabrication with the objective to remedy the role of fabrication tools in architectural history, sustainable architectural production, and in the field of digital heritage. In this paper, we report on two comparative studies that illustrate how the instrumental factors of two historical crafts can be articulated using fabrication.

This paper describes a potential for the integration of micro-encapsulated phase change material (mircoPCM) into lightweight skins as a means of regulating internal climatic conditions of volumetric objects. Viewed through the lens of the recently completed series of quarter-scale cloudMAGNET prototypes tested in the cloud forests of Monteverde, Costa Rica, this research utilized a wound, flexible carbon fiber framework and a lightweight fabric skin coated with varying densities of microPCM. The prototypes were monitored using real-time collection of climate data throughout the testing. In this paper we will demonstrate how climatic variables such as temperature, humidity, and pressure can be passively manipulated by varying the form and energy storage properties of materials without the use of active mechanical systems. Produced to bring awareness to the rising cloud levels within the Monteverde cloud forest, this research is intended to explore the fundamental relationships of material, energy and form. Beyond these objectives, the paper will also illustrate how these methods can be more broadly applied to the development of thermal-regulating lightweight tensile structures. Such innovations could be utilized as a method for the reimagining the architectural design and production processes allowing for the emergence of new typologies of environmentally self-mediating architecture.

During the '60s, theorists and architects such as Yona Friedman proposed visions for megastructures where residents could freely come and build their units with individual variations. However, there were no technological means to build such structures, and these visions appeared to be unrealistic at the time. This paper discusses how those visions could be re-envisioned through the use of anticipated new technologies and speculates about possible structures and their impacts on our living.

Optimization of Natural Ventilation process in highrise buildings is one of the most complex and least addressed phenomenon in the field of sustainable architecture. This issue requires urgent consideration to reduce the computation time due to fast growing demand of vertical construction in metropolitan cities. Until recently most highrise buildings have been operated with mechanical systems, causing high energy loads in hot climates and have high carbon footprints. Highrise buildings with natural ventilation and sky gardens can address these problems. This study involves the development of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) addressing the multi objective optimization of natural ventilation in tall buildings incorporated with Sky-Gardens at different levels all connected through a central ventilation shaft. The fitness function for this GA is composed of three scales; temperature reduction due to evapotranspiration of plants of sky-gardens, optimum wind velocity for channelizing air inside the corridors and ventilation shaft, and optimum building configuration. The aim is to find the best solutions for tall buildings constructed in hot climate through the provision of optimized airflow paths suitable for the effectiveness of natural ventilation, within a reasonably short computation time for supporting design processes at early stage.

This paper aims to link human's emotions and cognition to the built environment to improve the user's mental health and well-being. It focuses on cyber-physical adaptive spaces that can respond to the user's physiological and psychological needs based on their biological and neurological data. Through artificial intelligence and affective computing, this paper seeks to create user-oriented spaces that can learn from occupant's behavioral patterns in real-time, reduce user's anxiety and depression, enhance environmental quality, and promote more flexible human-centered designs for people with mental/physical disabilities. To achieve its objectives, this research integrates tangible computing devices/interfaces, robotic self-adjusting structures, interactive systems of control, programmable materials, human behavior, and a sensory network. Through embedded responsiveness and material intelligence, the goal is to blur the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres and create cyber-physical spaces that can ``feel'' and be controlled by the user's mind and feelings.

Understanding human behavior and preferences are important for urban planning and the design of walkable neighborhoods. However, it remains challenging to study human activity patterns because significant efforts are required to collect the relevant data, convert unstructured data into useful knowledge, and take into consideration different urban contexts. In the context of the heated discussion about urban walkability and amenities, as well as the need of identifying a feasible approach to analyze human activities, this paper proposes a simple and effective metric of the amenity demand patterns, which demonstrates the spatiotemporal distribution of human activities according to the activeness in urban amenities. Such metric has the potential to support the urban study about people, mobility, and built environment, as well as other relevant design thinking. Further, a case study illustrates the data and the new metric can be used in walkability simulations and amenity utilization analysis, thus informing the design decision-making process.

Digital architecture developed in the 1960s and, supported by CAAD the 1990s, has created the path towards an architecture produced by computer and architect in a mutual relationship. The evolution of architecture since the 1970s led to the beginning of the first digital turn in the 1990s, and subsequently to the emergence of new typologies of buildings, architects and design tools; atom-based, bit-based (virtual) [1], and cyber-physical as a combination of both. The paper provides an insight into historical foundations of CAAD insofar as it engages with complexity in mechanics, geometry, and space between the 1600s and 1950s. I will address a selection of principles discovered, and mechanisms invented before computer-aided-architectural-design; those include the typewriter, the Cartesian grid and a pre-cyber-physical system by Hermann von Helmholtz. The paper concludes with a summary and an outlook to the future of CAAD challenged by the variety of correlations of disparate data sets.

The research presented in this paper explores a novel tactile sensor technology for architectural assembly tasks. In order to enable robots to interact both with humans and building elements, several robot control strategies had to be implemented. Therefore, we developed a communication interface between the architectural design environment, a tactile sensor and robot controllers. In particular, by combining tactile feedback with real-time gripper and robot control algorithms, we demonstrate grasp adaptation, object shape and texture estimation, slip and contact detection, force and torque estimation. We investigated the integration of robotic control strategies for human-robot interaction and developed an assembly task in which the robot had to place vertical elements underneath a deformed slab. Finally, the proposed tactile feedback controllers and learned skills are combined together to demonstrate applicability and utility of tactile sensing in collaborative human-robot architectural assembly tasks. Users were able to hand over building elements to the robot or guide the robot through the interaction with building elements. Ultimately this research aims to offer the possibility for anyone to interact with built structures through robotic augmentation.

Contemporary architecture is considered a dynamic system, capable of adapting to different needs, from environmental to functional ones. The term `Adaptable Architecture' describes an architecture from which specific components can be changed in relation to external stimuli. This change could be executed by the building system itself, transformed manually or it could be any other ability to be transformed by external forces (Leliveld et al.2017). Adaptability concept is therefore linked to motion and to recent advances in kinetic architecture. In our research we are studying the rules that we can use to design a kinetic architecture using origami. Parametric design allows us to digitally simulate the movement of origami structures, we are testing algorithmic modeling to generate doubly curvature surfaces starting from a designed surface and not from the process. Our main goal is to study the relationship between geometry, motion and shape. We are interested, in particular, in complex surface manufacture using origami technique to design a kinetic and reactive ceiling.

Urban design project development encompasses a wide range of disciplines and approaches, which often have separate goals, frameworks, and software tools. Lack of timely alignment of the disconnected expert inputs to the common vision leads to an increasing number of revisions and decreases chances for finding a compromise solution. We developed an intuitive browser-supported interface in order to incorporate various types of expert inputs and ways of representing the information to take a first step towards facilitating collaborative decision-making processes. The current paper describes the application of the developed tool on three exemplary case studies, where the expert and non-expert users' inputs are combined and analysed using Grasshopper scripts at the back-end. Pilot user studies conducted with professionals have shown that the tool has potential to facilitate collaboration across disciplines and compromise decisions, while most of the participants were still more likely to use it for communication with customers rather than the design team. It suggests that the interaction scheme of different actors with the tool needs to correspond better to the interaction of different actors during common negotiation processes. The findings suggest that the type of involvement of different stakeholders should be explored further in order to find the balance in functionality suitable for different parties.

This project sets up a design framework that promotes augmenting the human body's interactions exploring methods for merging and blending the users of physical and virtual environments, through the design of wearable devices that are embedded with sensors and actuators. This allows for haptic and visual feedback through the use of data that reflects changes in the surrounding physical environment, and visualized in the immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environment. We consider the Body Architectures project to serve as mechanisms for augmenting the body in relation to the virtual architecture. These wearable devices serve to bring a hyper-awareness to our senses, as closed-loop cybernetic systems that utilize `digitized' biometric and environmental data through the use of 3D scanning technologies and cloud point models, virtual reality visualization, sensing technologies, and actuation. The design of Body Architectures relies on hybrid design, transdisciplinary collaborations, to explore new possibilities for wearable body architectures that evolve human-machine-environment interactions, and create hyper awareness of the temporal, atmospheric qualities that make up our experience of space, as `sensorial envelopes' (Lally 2014).

Environmental comfort and space occupancy are essential considerations in architectural design process. FaÃ§ade systems deeply impact both aspects but are usually standardized. However, performance-based facade systems tackle these issues through computational design to devise non-homogeneous elements. This work proposes a ceramic facade system designed according to a performance-based process grounded on environmental analysis and parametric design to allow adaptation and geometric variation according to specific building demands on environmental comfort and functionality. In this process, the Design Science Research method guided the exploration of both design and evaluation, bridging the gap between theory and practice. Positive facade environmental performance were found from digital and physical models assessment in terms of radiation, illuminance, dampness (with ventilation) and temperature. Computational processes minimized radiation inside the building while maximized illuminance. Their association influenced on operative temperature, which dropped according to local dampness and material absorption. Accordingly, this design process associates not only environmental comfort and functionality concepts but also adaptability, flexibility, mass customization, personal fabrication, additive manufacturing concepts, being an example architectural design changes in the 4th Industrial Revolution.

Concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials globally, yet its industrial fabrication techniques continue to default to planar formwork and uniform cross sections for the sake of simplicity and predictability. /Concrete Form[ing]work/ evaluates state-of-the-art fabric formwork research and explores the industry's reticence to integrate these novel design approaches. This research has identified two challenges that have significantly hindered the adoption of fabric formwork in architectural design: complex tailoring of parametrically designed forms and the lack of accurate simulation tools for flexible formwork. /Concrete Form[ing]work/ develops methods to address both of these issues, providing an alternative approach to more simply tailor fabric forms and accurately simulate these patterns' response to casting. In doing so, this research has the potential to fundamentally change and streamline how the field of flexible formwork is approached and integrated within architectural design. This paper will present the process of parametrically tailoring non-developable surfaces from single sheets and document the advancement of these simulation tools.

The study presented in this paper is part of ongoing research that is exploring how digital design tools and technologies can support waste cardboard reuse for manufacturing architectural elements in a context of scarcity. For this study, we explore the use of a parametric design tool to design and fabricate three different architectural components using waste cardboard sheets: acoustic panels and two types of formwork for concrete. This design tool maximizes the smart reuse of a waste material and aids in the fabrication process by outputting instructions for cutting, scoring, and folding. This paper also demonstrates how parametric design tools can help reuse non-standard (dimensions variable) waste materials, mediating between measurable material conditions and desired material targets for designs.

The application of curved facade designs in contemporary architectural practice has become adamant in combining the digital tools with the material properties. By expanding the focus to manufacturing as well, the topic of waste is introduced. In order to avoid the generation of waste material during fabrication, in this research a workflow is introduced which describes the design of freeform surfaces out of expanded polystyrene blocks (EPS), while producing zero waste. The main premise is that a piece cut out of an EPS block has a piece that is left inside the block, its complement. Following the premise, it is only necessary to design one half of the freeform surface over a desired facade area and the other part would align to it. After the freeform surface is generated, a tessellation process is described, prepared for robotic hotwire cutting, following the limitation of the EPS block dimension and the inclusion of the minimal insulating layer.

Mass Engineered Timber products provide a unique opportunity in configuring panelized building systems that are suitable for both prefabrication and onsite customization. The structural nature of these large section elements also brings about the need for a coordinated design-fabrication-assembly workflow. These products can assume different geometric configurations and their behaviour can be approximated globally by simplifying framing schemas. Current BIM Interoperability standards such as STEP or IFC already acknowledge and support the interconnected nature of component properties, yet these Data Models are component focused. Expanding on the relationships between components and using sets to define part to whole, or exteriority relationships could yield a more flexible and agile querying of building information.This would be a framework fit for automated feature derivation and rule based design applications. To this end Graph structures and Graph Databases, alongside existing ontology authoring tools are studied to probe new cognitive possibilities in collaborative AEC workflows

This paper presents an approach towards the development of a service-oriented platform for semantic enrichment of indoor point clouds. It mainly focuses on integrated methods for the capture of as-is 3D point clouds using commodity mobile hardware, classification of point cloud clusters using a multiview-based method, geometric reconstruction of room boundaries, interactive 3D visualization, sensor data visualization, and tracking of spatial changes and user annotations via a secure ledger. Implementing the methods in a prototypical web-based application, we demonstrate our approach for the semantic enrichment of indoor point clouds and the generation of base data for Digital Twin representation.

The use of ICT-based participation tools in urban design has gained importance in the last decade. In order to enable the citizens and other stakeholders to participate in city-making processes, a wide range of ICT-enabled participatory tools, techniques, and applications have been developed.. Many studies have reported that the use of these participatory platforms has led to positive outcomes but the platforms` potentials and limits for facilitating different levels of design empowerment still remain unknown. In this context, this study aims to determine how these platforms empower citizens' engagement and identify the key factors that can facilitate better participation practices. This research analyses 25 ICT-based participation platforms by focusing on 4 key criteria:(1) their objectives, (2) the design action phases in which they are designated to be used, (3) their desired levels of design empowerment, and (4) offered functions. Our study reveals that more than three-fourth of analysed platforms still complemented by off-line participation activities. Empowering citizens to design independently is still a challenging task so just three platforms (12%) allow users to create their own plans and visions. Finally, we identify several influence factors for better ICT-based participatory design practices.

In the last decades, the quantity of information produced and distributed due to digital resources has been growing; big data is contributing to a better perception of our cities. The aim of this paper is to understand spatial segregation in the city of SÃ£o Paulo (a city known by its social inequality and urban poverty) by scraping social media tags of emotions. We compared aspects that suggest socio-spatial inequalities: urban poor versus feelings of love and hate, versus feelings of joy and fear and the social vulnerability index as background. Three issues are considered in this research: the emergence of urban space big data, digital inclusion, and architects and urbanists' access to big data. To unveil urban poor singularities through social media is an opportunity to reconnect communities to urban design.

This paper presents our findings on knowledge work environment usage behaviour through a combined automated mobile indoor positioning system and self-reports collected from the environment's inhabitants. Contemporary work environments are increasingly flexible multi-occupant environments as opposed to cellular offices. Understanding persons' task-related and situation-related environmental needs is critical to improve the design of future knowledge work environments. This study is conducted in a team office environment prior to and following an intervention in which the office layout was re-organized. The combined methodological approach described in this paper provides a new tool for architecture researchers aiming to understand the use of workspaces. Importantly, combining self-reports with context-aware location data collection provides researchers an efficient in situ tool to access participants experiences and decision-making process in choosing their workstation or workspace.

The paper theorises and elaborates the idea of crowd-driven assemblies for flexible and adaptive constructions utilising automatic technologies and participatory activities within the context of twenty-first century cities. As economic and technological movements and shifts in society and cultures are present and ongoing, the building technology needs to incorporate human inputs following the aspects of customisation to build adaptive architectural and urban scenarios based on immediate decisions made according to local conditions or specific spatial demands. In particular, the paper focuses on large-scale prototyping for urban applications along with on-site interactions between humans and automatic building technologies to create on-demand spatial scenarios. It discusses the current precedents in research and practice and speculates future directions to be taken in creation, development or customisation of contemporary and future cities based on participatory and crowd-driven building activities. The main aim of this theoretical overview is to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the relations between technology and humans in the context of reactive and responsive built environments.

Current dominance of functionalist and performance related approaches to computational design and methods in architecture are investigated under the precondition of Max Bense's theory of aesthetic potential. Establishing Bense's taxonomy of aesthetic potential and applying it to selected computational methods the level of aesthetic potential within the different computational approaches is investigated. Frei Otto's soap bubble experiments serve as a reference to illustrate different levels of aesthetic potential. Bense's aesthetic potential, which lies not in the eye of the beholder but is immanent to the object itself as a property of the object, suggests that computational design systems synthesising objects based on rules or embedded constraints appear to either have little aesthetic potential or receive their aesthetic potential form the outside of the computational system, namely the interaction with the user. Evolutionary design systems appear to create objects or processes with a certain aesthetic potential within Bense's theoretical framework.
